I think this is working now.  So!

Hello,

I spent the morning on toplap.org, and now we have a nicer wiki (a
'usemod' one) and a mailman mailing list.

I also invited Amy Alexander into the project as we discussed...  Maybe
we should hold back from any full-blown discussion until we hear from
her (shouldn't be longer than a day).

Now I need to find a haircut

Hello

Amy joined us -- welcome Amy!  Her participation is limited by her lack
of time, but that's probably true of all of us to some extent.  We're
not under any time pressure anyway.

So lets go over what we might want to achieve...

1. Interesting discussions ...
2. ... somehow leading to a 'manifesto'
3. which could lead to some kind of tongue-in-cheek ratification of live
coding performances...  In a similar way to how Dogme 95 works - a set
of rules, and films which follow the rules are officially deemed to be
Dogme 95 films

And personally, the ultimate aim for me would be to explore new ways of
performing with code.  At the moment I work with code as musical
material while performing, starting and stopping various scripts,
tweaking parameters and sometimes interacting with it.  This could very
loosely be termed 'live coding', but I don 't actually write code during
a performance, and I'd like to try.

Fredrik hit on some important questions earlier, which we haven't tried
to answer here yet...

It patching programming?  

James McCartney has something to say about this:
http://www.ai.mit.edu/~gregs/ll1-discuss-archive-html/msg03610.html

I think the answer has to be yes, but it's a different flavour of
programming from textual languages.

Luckily, Programming and Patching share the same initial letter so we
can interchange them (as you can see from the toplap wiki, the words
behind the TOPLAP acronym aren't fixed, amy).

Limiting ourselves to ASCII (or even UTF8) seems arbitrary.  But we
don't necessarily want to let people contruct sequences in cubase and
call that live programming!

One idea we had was to have TOPLAP ratified programming languages and
programming methods, and a procedure that people would follow to get
their particular programming/performance environment ratified.

Subject: [livecode] an angle to cut out iTunes?


Alex's comment on code running in the mind of the programmer (from the OS 
paper) is probably quite pertinent. Also to remember are the continuums of 
interaction (power of controls with respect to parameter space of music?) 
and of gestural content, particularly directness of expressive detail- 
no-one can code with haptic rate timing deviations for expressivity...

live coding allows the exploration of abstract algorithm spaces as an 
intellectual improvisation.

thought experiment- someone writes down an instruction list for their use 
of iTunes. They proceed to HDJ according to this instruction set. But 
halfway through they modify the list.

Was that live coding?

We'll probably always be a bit stuck facing the continuum. But we can 
encourage rather than demand- so that common sense prevails. Profundity of 
change and depth of insight into code and dmusic representation to be 
applauded.

There are some here:

I think the main thing that tripped me up with this one is that to make

It also turns 'wiki words' into links...  A wiki word being a word with

howdy all!

yes, i may have to lurk most of the time due to current realities, but i 
am excited to join and will try tokeep up as much as i can. 

some uber-brief intro to my interest in live coding performance. i spent 
most of my growing-up years doing musical performances of various kinds. 
eventually i wound up in film, video (real-time and not), computer 
animation, unix systems administration, and media art projects made 
through programming of various kinds. my first sys-admin performances were 
by accident, because i used to get absorbed in what i was doing and type 
very fast and suddenly look up to find all the animators in the lab where 
i worked grinning at me. 

anyway, being a leisure-oriented lazy person, i eventually got interested
in how computers were changing pop culture. i came to the conclusion that
while computers could be used for cool things like music and video, that
they'd brought the business paradigm with them into pop culture. so you
could go to a club and hear some great laptop techno music, but it could
look just like they were doing database programming. quite a shift from
sweaty guitar bands. so cool pop/leisure culture gets more boring; but on 
the other hand, geek culture seems to get continually more cool and 
mainstreamed. (case modding, slashdot, e.g.) 

so anyway, somehow in all this i became a geek vj, trying to make club 
culture "cool" by being an extra cool geek (tongue-in-cheek, more or 
less.) so one thing i do in shows is try to be very performative about my 
typing. (this is more explicit or less in various projects.)

so, i'm very interested in the performative aspects of live-coding.  
live-coding can invert the usual electronic music performance assumptions
i think, because it's now coding-as-improv, i.e. live composition, rather
than software-usage as performance. (of course, there places in between
those two extremes, which alex and frederick have already mentioned.)
but anyway, seems like a good way in which a "geek approach" to computers 
in pop culture can provide an ultimately less-nerdy alternative to the 
traditional ways this integration has taken place. 
 
so... some initial questions from me:

1) is this all about music? (e.g., i work from the visuals side of things. 
then again, i'm not specifically live coding, either... ) 

2) are we interested in the performative aspects of live coding, the 
conceptual aspects, or both? in other words, is the audience always made 
aware of the live coding process? how? are the performers' displays shown 
on screens? do we see their fingers typing? 

2a) if we're interested in the audience's experience of the coding 
performance - how much of this is about typing vs. coding? i remember from 
alex's impromptul 5-minute coding performance at transmediale last year, 
the audience was very excited to watch alex's cursor fly around in emacs. 
fortunately, alex is not only a whiz at coding, but also moves like a 
dancer in emacs. so now that's 3 things - coding well live, typing skill, 
and a particularly visual facility with a text editor. do we separate 
those issues? for the audience? for ourselves? what about lowly vim users 
like me? ;-) ... and, how to address these issues without degenerating 
into emacs/vi wars? 

3) is live coding inclusive or competitive? i.e., does one need to be the 
fastest, most proficient coder to do perform live? if so, it might prove 
programming prowess but exclude people with interesting ideas and a feel 
for live performance, but who aren't as quick at the programming end of 
things. or, can both approaches be accomodated, for example, through 
various types of languages?

4) from this question, as well as the issue of cubase sequences, it seems 
to me that we've hit on the idea that the distinction between programmer 
and user is really more of a continuum than a line in the sand. and after 
all, programmers are users anyway, using C++, perl, various libraries, 
etc.

yeah, i'd also vote for keeping things as loose as possible, and then 
providing some rationale for whatever admittedly-subjective line we decide 
to draw (and that the line can be crossed for particular situations - 
what if someone constructs a turing-complete language out of cubase 
sequences? ;-) )

i'm not sure i follow the rationale for this? it sounds a little like it
could create a feeling of an exclusive club to me like it could discourage
people from working in new directions... but maybe i missed something? 

sorry if any/all of this is stuff that's been discussed already! i know it 
can be weird when new people join a group and then bring up the same 
things that have been gone over before... hoping to catch up soon! :-)

thank you for your introduction!

I would suggest it is not all about music (as probably music is not 
all about music either)
My personal interest is to get away from the idea of production - so 
if music as a product then I'd even say it is not about music.

I use live-coding mostly for film sound, so there is no 'performance' as
such. But when playing for an audience or with an audience, I would
try to show the code. I was a bit unhappy about our last performance 
at betalounge in Hamburg - they showed fingers typing as a maximum -
why should this be so very interesting? But again this is my personal view.
    
>

this is a good point. I would hope it is about live coding - the problem
as I see it is about understanding, semantics.

I'm a 2 - 3 finger typer and I'm totally desinterested in typing 
speed apart from practical consideration. I find it fascinationg to 
be quick, but who  would
judge a speech from its speed, for example?

this would be the thing I hated most and would be the furthest possible
away from the idea I had about it in the first place. Mostly I dislike
the outcome of combinations of sports and music.

generally I would say that live coding doesn't even have to be specifically
interesting or in the center of attention. For me it is another way to think
about language and computers, and another way to interfere with sound - it
is good if it is visible what's going on, but not for sake of showing off,
but for being able to understand it and to have conversation about it
and with it.

Hear hear. If I may digress slightly, and bring in another related 
consideration we mustn't lose sight of:

There is considerable snobbery amongst coders, even amongst friends. 
There are too many misconceptions, and too much rivalry between skill 
sets. There were raised eyebrows in the audience in Hamburg when it was 
revealed that I use REALbasic to make music. Later, over food, there 
was considerable surprise that whilst Alex is the "perl one" and I was 
"REALbasic one", I was the one who wrote the slub sound engine in C. 
Heavens above! I know how to use gcc as well as a mouse. How did that 
happen? Coders are the worse at this. Not even stroppy prima donna 
artists do it.

Amy asked if we should be inclusive or competitive. I suggest we need 
to be inclusive (fairly obviously given my experience), but let's be 
careful that we dont endorse or promote any particular practice, since 
it'd be easy for that to be misconstrued in the eyes of a community of 
coders who are conditioned to judge by tools alone. My line is that 
it's not the tools that are of interest, but how you use them.

Note that this differs somewhat from the "graphical 
programming/patching" debate.

For my next project, I'll be writing a raytracer in Visual Basic. The 
core renderer will be implemented using DOS batch files, though.

Is REALbasic really frowned upon that much?  I guess it's a Macintosh
culture thing.

I think the same unfounded snobbery can be found upon other artistic
mediums however - for example painting, watercolours and so on (we both
know the disrespect that the various flavours of fine arts student
discord to each other in badly managed academic situations...).  I guess
the problem is that a medium becomes embedded in a culture, and gets
dumb stereotypes attached.  Then you get the conformists reinforcing the
stereotypes.

I agree.  How can we define "live coding" in these terms?

We could take the runme.org approach, of challenging what we disagree
with by taking it to ridiculous levels.  So having a page for officially
ratified TOPLAP live coding performance systems and having thousands of
languages in there.

Anyway - we are talking about performance, and for me an essential part
of being audience to a musical performance (for example) is seeing the
movements that make the music.  It connects me physically with the
music.  If I went to see a violinist and he turned his back on me so I
couldn't see his fingers move, I'd wonder why I didn't just buy a CD
instead.

So in relation to live coding, movement needs to be visible.  So seeing
a mouse being moved or a keyboard being tapped at does help.  But even
better is seeing the processes move.  Nick and Fred's joint visual +
audio performances seem like an ideal.  But letting your screen be seen,
so that the movements within the interface can be seen exposes more of
the process.  The audience might not understand any more of the process
(watching a guitarist perform doesn't help a non-musician learn about
chord structures), but they are nevertheless allowed to witness
movements of musical processes.

The only alternative in my opinion is to have a dance floor, so that the
audience adds the movements themselves.  The non-alternative is to
instead sell recordings so that the audience can listen how they like (I
don't believe people really want to sit listening to music in expensive
theatres at some random point within a stereo field sitting next to
sniffing, coughing strangers).

was it you alex or julian who brought up apple's new garage band

it sure is ugly and scares me.  crap music will be flooding.  ableton 
live is another good case study i think.

defining live-coding will probably be difficult and might take time.  
but couldn't we try to break down the problem and see what we can agree 
upon at the moment?
dare i suggest we all can agree with alex above on a notion of playing 
with open cards (in practice... project our screens during performance 
or if that not possible at least not hide away behind the screen 
looking 'very serious').  trying to share and communicate by 
visualising, in whatever way, what's going on in the computer and our 
minds?

i got another thought though...
if you project any sequencer program it will be instantly obvious 
what's going on.  on-screen knobs and faders bores you and after a few 
minutes you'll loose interest - maybe in the resulting music too.  it's 
hard to be a virtuoso in ableton live.  rather, isn't the thing about 
live coding the curiosity of how it really works?  at least slub makes 
my brain spin trying to figure it out.  i just love the expectation 
seeing a command executed and listening for its effect in the music.  
or which chunk of unreadable terminal output belongs to which sounds.  
i'm not proposing making things more difficult than needed but isn't it 
a trick of the trade to keep some secrets, arise curiosity (and thereby 
dialogue) and not letting the audience grasp the whole working process 
at once?

nono, you didn't miss much.  we just got started really.


googling for 'live coding' brought this up 
http://www.eagle-software.com/snobol_review.htm  witness of a delphi 
live coding happening.
"If you thought that programming was always a personal, selfish 
pleasure, then you should have seen this: a British audience 
(correction: a British audience of programmers ) shouting out and 
competing with each other and actually cheering and bursting into 
spontaneous applause "
is this something to strive for?  the [delphi] guru at the keys and an 
[delphi] audience that can appreciate all twists and turns and 
contribute.  sounds a little romantic in my ears.

actually renate said to me (raising eyebrows) that this is really 
done in Visual Basic she found it very nice that this language known

hm, reminds me a bit being in india being the "angresi" (english) and

I think the idea of "level of abstraction" in programming language 
should be abandoned as far as possible, as well as "value" of a 
certain language.

julian, could you expand on this a little please?

Am I misrepresenting you if I say :

you want to explore programming languages as thought empowerers and 
mindsets in performance. Because conventional fixed GUIs allow no abstract 
thought, generalisation, meta-statements, interpreted languages are a 
better medium for tackling such issues as performance art?

Can we all agree that there are many potential languages (and many that 
would be intriguing to use, even if supposedly less optimised to audio 
etc...), and no one optimal live coding solution?

Are we allowed to discuss languages though in terms of their 
abstractions/representations- this is surely critical to their use and 
appreciation. Whilst in no way denigrating the artistic choice of a 
particular set of constraints on a live coding performance through a 
particular medium...

Subject: [livecode] thought experiment 2


(contentious)

Live coding is the act of changing the nature of running generative 
algorithms in real-time during performance. This is usually achieved 
through the power of interpreted programming languages. Whilst one might 
alter the data set, it is the modification of the instructions and control 
flow of processes themselves that contributes the most exciting action of 
the medium.

so-

does the live coder have to understand the consequences of an algorithm 
change? Or just be curious to make a change?

ie change Neural Net weights, explore emergent properties...


(I assume the answer is yes, that's fine- ongoing feedback of trial and 
error is good)

Now change an algorithm that was acting as an automated algorithm changer. 
This is really just a change to many things at once. Iterate that through 
multiple levels past ability of humans to track (over eight levels of 
abstraction usually enough cognitively speaking).

one for connisseurs of live coding?

yes, this I think is an important point. In performance would mean 
that what is in action is not the application (the tool) but the 
grammar and the language (the algorithm). What I try to describe is a 
perpective more than a thing in itself.

well I would not find it wrong to count GUI activities as performance art.
UI is a metaphor of acting and of worlds so why not apply this term 
to artistic treatment of windows and such things like buttons and 
mouse clicks - this is just another example that for artistic work a 
distinction cannot be made between a good and a bad medium in general.

optimum has no general meanings, so I would always agree to this.
I find it important though that we have to ratify the acceptance of a 
certain language first. (:

of course. I was pointing at a very common paradigm that builds a 
world order from low-level to high-level languages, which I find has 
its right but is not that useful as soon it comes to semantics and 
artistic programming.

Ps swiki down at moment so can't check a couple of fine details...


Changing grammars: a live audio programming symposium
12-14 February 2004
Hamburg, Hochschule fur      Kuntz.
http://swiki.hfbk-hamburg.de:8888/MusicTechnology/609

This symposium brought together a number of practitioners and experimenters 
in the field of live coding, that is, on-the-fly programming as an 
improvisatory and exploratory activity. The three day meeting involved many 
informal workshops, and eventually some presentations on the Friday 
evening, before a public concert on the Saturday at the betalounge in the 
city centre.

The art school provided a seminar room with network sockets for all 
attendees. Every symposium visitor had a laptop and the workshops proceeded 
with networked music spawned on inbuilt speakers. The workshops were 
documented on the fly via the swiki site hosted in the university.

The event was organised thanks to the endeavour of Julian Rohrhuber, author 
of the jitlib extensions to SuperCollider and main workshop leader. As well 
as many further active participants, invited guests included London 
laptopists slub (Alex McLean and Ade Ward) renowned for their linux command 
line and custom software programming antics , Alberto da Campo presenting 
his ProxyMixer for jitlib, Sekhar Ramakrishan, Martin Carle and audiovisual 
duo klipp av. A virtual presense was Ge Wang from Princeton (author of the 
new Chuck language for live programming) who made a video appearance.

A website and mailing list have been setup to follow up issues raises at 
the conference (http://www.toplap.org). These ideas are not restricted to 
music but can extend through the generative arts.

Yes.  Perhaps if movement of processes/interfaces are not visible then
there must be room for the audience to dance, to make their own
movements.  Either that or there should be complete darkness.

It would be good to define the different aspects of live coding that we
find on the website as some point.  It would make it easier to think
about it all.

I think there could be a subtle but important point here.

A programmer/musician/artist often needs quite a particular and
individual environment in which to work.  For example I like to think
about what to program while I'm dancing, decide how I'm going to program
it in the bath, and actually program it in quiet and comfortable
surroundings such as my studio or sofa.

The idea of going to a club, getting on stage, creating a source file
and beginning to compose the next 40 minutes of entertainment is kind of
ridiculous.

So I think a more practical approach is to start with a pre-prepared
composition, but instead of building in interfaces and parameters, you
change the variables and structures in the code directly, and modify the
composition over time to produce (for example) musical progression.  As
the code is edited it immediately gets interpreted and the sound
changes.  This seems to be how Julian works with his jitlib.

So you can start off with fairly static composition and make changes to
it over time to turn it into a performance.

No, I think the visual and other mediums are just as relevant, within
the context of time-based performance.

As I think I said replying to a later mail; if there is any kind of
visual spectacle as part of a sonic performance or vice-versa, then they
should be closely related.  Seeing what is causing (or caused by) the
sound (or the process that makes the sound) brings us closer to the
sound, and so the visual becomes part of the musical experience.

Of course someone could say they have unrelated sound and visuals in
their performance, that this somehow works, and that no-one should tell
them otherwise.

Fair enough - our job at TOPLAP is not to decide what is a perfect
audio, visual or a/v performance, but to define what constitutes a
TOPLAP performance.  Ie, a particular type of performance that we think
is interesting, worthwhile and should happen more often.

I don't think we should be trying to define the perfect performance in
general terms.

In my experience, typing is a good way of engaging the audience in
certain contexts but not others...  For example an audience which is
sitting down drinking wine might find it engaging to watch an editor
being expertly used.  

I don't think projecting the editor above a dancefloor encourages people
to dance however!  It's hard to read when you're jumping up and down, so
a lot of people just stand and watch.  That's a shame; when you're
dancing the processes really become alive around your movements.  You
don't need to see anything.

However, typing is central to a lot of programming activity so should be
flagged up as a useful performative tool.

I agree with Ade that it shouldn't be competitive in general, although I
heard about 'competitive poetry' recently - if poetry performance can be
competitive then why not programming?

I feel that a live coding performance requires some deep understanding
of the code that is being performed with.  If the performer was the one
who programmed the code then they will already have this deep
understanding.

So yes, we can be inclusive to a point, but we can only include
programmers.

Agreed.  I think we have to draw that line in the sand somewhere though,

If the procedure to get things ratified were easy and open, then it's
not an exclusive club.

But of course that's a big 'if', the word music is applied to many
things.  For example can have paintings which contain musical forms
(such as those by Paul Klee and M. K. Ciurlionis).  For me that's the
kind of music is what is interesting to explore.  So live programming
can be about this kind of music, but only as one option to explore.

I do think it's also interesting to think about music as a product, to
sometimes try to make a 'track' that people can listen to over and over,
and get to know as something that is unchanging but that still sounds
different every time.  But performance isn't about such a product and so
perhaps that shouldn't concern us here.

Maybe we should call ourselves TOPLaP, and not include the 'audio' bit
in the explanation.  We could use 'art' or 'artistic' there, but these
words can be problematic.

Agreed.  It's like when an expert guitarist is playing and they focus
the camera on the right hand plucking away, when all the cool stuff is
being done by the left hand.  In this case the interest isn't in the
fact that the fingers are typing away, but in what they are typing.  You
generally can't see what is being typed by watching the keyboard, you
have to watch the screen.

Frederick's problems were particularly annoying, they kept projecting
the MAX objects instead of the output of them.

It might well have been me.  I'm not sure if we need to be negative in
directly criticising these applications.  I'd feel uneasy about it for a
start - "some of my best friends use ableton live."  I don't think I

Perhaps we can agree in "exposing the movement of the process" to the
audience, or allowing them to expose it for themselves (by dancing).

You probably don't manage to work it out though!  Just have fun trying. 
We've played to riotous dancefloors in amsterdam, berlin, paris,
barcelona and london without projecting our screens and people have
really got into the music as sound.

But I think there's a danger there of making a performance that only
programmers can appreciate.  That's a bit like making art for art
critics, a bit self-defeating in my opinion.

I was thinking for a while about how to arrange text output of the code
that's running while I edit it.  I was thinking about having half the
screen occupied by the text editor and the other half containing the
output of the program.

Then I had an idea - why not just have one window, and let the program
modify its code?  Then the program can modify its own algorithms on the
fly, and add comments to the code that comment upon the status of the
running process.  So that's what I've done...

Subject: [livecode] two challenges



I've just been listening to a Harry Partch interview in which he talks
about music requiring 'corporeality ' and 'ritual'. Tangible computing live
coding at my funeral then I hope.


On another related note, I don't know how much you all hang around
libraries at the moment but if you get a chance to see Journal of New Music
Research 32:3 Andrew Schloss' article 'Using Contemporary Technology in
Live Performance; the Dilemma of the Performer' he has much to complain
about. I quote directly from his conclusions list to be provocative on his
behalf:

'
1. cause-and-effect is important, at least for the observer/audience in a
concert venue
2. corollary: Magic in a performance is good. Too much magic is fatal!
(boring)
3. a visual component is essential to the audience, such that there is a
visual display of input parameters/gestures. The gestural aspect of the
sound becomes easier to experience.
4. Subtlety is important. huge gestures are easily visible from far away,
which is nice, but they are cartoon movements compared to playing a musical
instrument.
5. Effort is important. In this regard, we are handicapped in computer
music performance.
6. Improvisation on stage is good, but "baby-sitting" the apparatus on
stage is not improvisation, it is editing. It is probably more appropriate
to do this either in the studio before the concert, than at the concert in
the middle or back of the concert hall.
7. People who perform should be performers. A computer music concert is not
an excuse/opportunity for a computer programmer to finally be on stage.
Does his/her presence enhance the performance or hinder it?
'



I will not respond to these points directly, seething as I am, except to
mention my own comments on Schloss' live performance in Cuba 2001:

Ultimately, Andrew Schloss on radio drum and Ernan Lopez-Nussa at the piano
played Schloss's Blind Data together. The best I can hope for is that it
was guided improvisation. Certainly the percussive speed of the duo was
impressive. Those wands blurred in mid air, the gestures were viscerally
convincing. A case of nice performance, shame about the output. The aural
result was often an unfocused mess, and not helped by the terrible ( I
hesitate to make the ultimate accusation of general MIDI) patches being
controlled by the radio drum. Imagine- now I'll dramatically shift to
channel 9- The Gong Patch. The Steinway on it's own would have been of
wonderful acoustic quality, if a flawed end to a computer music concert.
Ultimately, we can all sympathise with the sort of improvisation where you
know the musicians are having fun and perhaps the audience's ears are
extraneous.

I will quiz Ron about this in person at the end of the month, we should

Subject: paper
From: "alex" <alex


Hi TOPLAP,

Happily, we had our paper accepted to the READ_ME software art festival.

The festival is in two parts; the "Software Art and Cultures" conference
from 23rd to 24th August and the "runme-dorkbot city camp" from 25th to
27th August.

http://readme.runme.org/

The paper is accepted for the conference part.  It would be nice if we
could do some kind of workshop, collaborations, demonstrations and some
performances as part of the citycamp part.

If you can make it, please register for the runme part now.  There's
free accommodation and money available for travel too.  It's all
explained on the registration form.

It would be fantastic to present our ideas at the academic conference
and develop them further during the citycamp.

Anyway, due to some mix-ups with the paper we haven't got much time to
write it.  It needs to be ready for printing by 1st June!  What makes
this worse is that Ade and I are also collaborating on another paper for
the conference, about generative art.

What ideas do we want to get across in this paper?  Who wants to help
write it?  How should we structure and write it?

Congratulations!  I am yet to achieve this milestone, but am working

By the way, who could be in London on the 17th July?  That's the date
set for the London Placard headphone festival.  20 minute performances
over 14 hours, where the audience listens on headphones.  It's going to

Hi,

Tonight I've been trying to write something, anything, for this read_me
paper.  Here's what I came up with, a kind of introduction.  Some of the
ideas in it might be useful anyway.  I also fiddled with the wiki, and
typed some possible section titles in.  Anyway, it's gotten late, so
here's the text without further ado:


There are many similarities between software and music.  For example,
both exist as a set of instructions to be interpreted and executed to
produce a temporal form.  I play this music I've scored, I run this
software I've hacked together; I breathe life into my work.

The forms of software and music have been intertwined, not only by
musicians exploring their ideas as software processes but also by
programmers exploring their ideas as music processes.  Software
environments such as CSound, MAX/MSP and SuperCollider are new
playgrounds in which we may all explore the processes of music;
describing and manipulating processes that make the music, rather than
the music itself.

Terms such as "generative music" and "process music" have been
invented and appropriated to describe this new approach to
composition.  But the focus of this text is not to explore this
approach, but to explore how such music should be performed.

This is great, I have begun to be enthused! I added this to the swiki along 
with some sorting of refs, intro etc. I added a definition of live coding 
to get us started wrangling- please discuss:


Live coding is the act of programming under real-time constraints, for an 
audience, as an artistic entertainment. Any software art may be programmed, 
but the program should have demonstrable consequences within the 
performance venue. A performance that makes successive stages of the code 
construction observable, for example, through the use of an interpreted 
programming language, may be the preferred dramatic option. Text interfaces 
and compiler quirks are part of the fun, but a level of virtuosity in 
dealing with the problems of code itself, as well as in the depth of 
algorithmic beauty, may provide a more connoisseurial angle into the 
display.

Never happy with anything I might write, I've reworked the introduction
and updated it in the wiki.  I hope it's an improvement!  I think
through these paragraphs I'm aiming to slowly bring people from the
over-exposed ideas of Eno et al, to our more interactive approach.  Is
that a worthwhile aim?


There are many comparisions to be made between software and music.
For example, both exist as a set of instructions to be interpreted and
executed to produce a temporal form.  I play this music I've scored, I
run this software I've hacked together; I breathe life into my work.

Indeed, some musicians explore their ideas as software processes,
often to the point that a software becomes the essence of the music.
At this point, the musicians may also be thought of as programmers
exploring their code manifested as sound.  This does not reduce their
primary role as a musician, but complements it, with unique
perspective on the composition of their music.

Terms such as "generative music" and "processor music" have been
invented and appropriated to describe this new perspective on
composition.  Much is made of the alleged properties of so called
"generative music" that separate the composer from the resulting work.
Brian Eno likens making generative music to sowing seeds that are left
to grow.  Much is made of how we may give up control to our processes,
leaving them to "play in the wind."  This is only one approach to
combining software with music, one that this paper wishes to counter
quite strongly.  We advocate the humanisation of generative music,
where code isn't left alone to meander through its self-describing
soundscape, but is hacked together, chopped up and moulded to
make live music.

Hi all,

The live coding workshops and performances at the runme/dorkbot citycamp
need some planning.  It would be perfect if we could all be there, and
there are travel bursaries available to help make that possible.

More info and registration details: http://readme.runme.org

The plans for the festival are coming together nicely, it seems there
will be plenty of space for discussing, developing and relaxing.

Who is planning on making it?  Any ideas for what we should do?

By the way I met David Toop briefly last night.  He's a music
journalist, musician and author, and has just had a book published about
digital music (among other things), called "Haunted weather."  I met him
after panel discussion he was leading, where quite some time was spent
pondering the problems of laptop performance...  All the usual problems
were brought up, all of which we have successfully conquered to some
degree!

Anyway, I gave him a copy of the live programming article (I just got
five copies in the post), and he said he'd like to talk about it. 
Apparently he is now being paid for four years to explore these issues. 
A useful contact for TOPLAP, I think.

Best

Here's another unedited ramble.  With this I'm trying to describe my
live code editor, which has just been given the name of feedback.pl. 
There is more to type, but in its finished form it'll accompany a public
GPL release of the feedback.pl.  Perhaps some parts can be butchered one
or both of the papers however.

The theme is strongly inspired by Paul Klee's Pedagogical Sketchbook,
which I recommend.


feedback.pl

A painter, Paul Klee, moves to make a mark on a canvas.  Immediately
after this initial moment the first counter motion occurs; that of
receptivity, as the painter sees what he has painted.  Klee therefore
controls whether what he has produced so far is good.

A humble programmer, Yaxu Paxo, moves to type an algorithm into a
computer.  The motion of the cursor runs across the screen, leaving a
trail of words and symbols behind.  With the first outward motion
complete, the inward motion begins; the eye saccades across the text
on the screen, seeking out mistaken indentations, mismatching
parenthesis, ambiguities and misnomers.  Then the focus adjusts,
accommodating the whole textual structure.  The activities and
properties described by the code are viewed as features of an
imaginary object, abstract but somehow shapely.  In this way, the
program executes in Yaxu's head.

But this special program is also running in the computer.  As soon as
Yaxu makes a change to the text, the computer moves it into
running code.  Yaxu imagines a form in his mind, works out
instructions for his computer to reproduce that form, and the computer
follows the instructions as soon as Yaxu has typed them.

These intructions are of course far from absolute.  They interact with
the outside world, perhaps with with a person, or otherwise create
cryptographic fog from system activity.  There are many tools
available to a programmer to create enough uncertainty to drive
determinism far from their work.  A painter may place her ink drawing
under a running tap, a sculptor may let his delicate sculpture sway in
the wind, a programmer may call a random number generator.

As a musician Yaxu's real aim is not only to externalise the form so
that it may be built inside a computer, but to have the programmed
computer transform it into sound.  So the form passes from the
imagination into textual program code, and is executed to ultimately
recreate the form as sound.

Then comes the strongest movement of all, from sound in the ear to
music in the mind.

That was the passage of music from the imagination, into
musical instructions for a machine to follow, to musical movement as
of the machine executing the instructions, to musical sounds triggered
by the machine's modulations, to music reforming in Yaxu's mind.  

Yaxu controls whether what he has produced so far is good, and feeds
his reaction back into the code.

If programmer is to share the continuous artistic process of a
painter, this movement must be dynamic, it must be quick.  Code must
be interpreted by the computer as soon as it can be written, and the
results reacted to as soon as they can be experienced.

(sort of like my cyberspaceland project, but with code, and much simpler).  
though i'm experimenting with including the ability to pull in the whole

the concept of feedback (but in this case, the whole thing's a feedback
loop anyway... this is somehow reassuring because the concept of video 
feedback in digital vj tools always disturbs me a little - since computers 
have no optics they can't "see" their own output like in the original video 
feedback with cameras. i like awake nights worrying about that.)

of course the devil is in the details and i should really find some time
make The Thingee a bit less rough than it is, and actually get good enough
at performing it to make it entertaining to watch and not just a
conceptual one-liner... time is not one of my assets these days, but
hopefully i'll have enough time in the coming weeks/months to get this
going at least on a basic level... if so, would be cool if there's some
time within the livecode-related activities at the r&d camp - if you think
it fits in, i would be honored to do some quickee performance of it...

in keeping with my new "foot-operated software" crusade, i may also add 
an option where you can do the live coding with your feet on a DDR pad. 
(this would have the added benefit of bringing the world one step closer 
to the elusive goal of dancing about architecture.) i 
think i've actually figured out a warped hack for doing that, but i'd 
really have to  be much less tired than i am now before i could attempt 
such a feet <sic>.

Live coding does open up some interesting experiments in feedback
loops.  Which is good, because it seems to me that the whole point of
performance are feedback loops of one kind to another...  Between the
performer and the audience, between the performer and the environment
(accoustics, etc), between the performer and her creation and so on...

I'd love to see this - I have a project here:
http://www.pawfal.org/Software/fluxus/ which runs scheme scripts to read audio
input and make realtime animations. 

I guess this is a bit different to your idea in that the movement is coming
from audio, but the "scenes" you build are script driven.

The actual script interface is in a seperate window to the renderer currently.
At the moment it sort of resembles the maya mel script editor in that you
write code, and highlight it to execute it in fragments. That way you can
build up a palette of function calls and bits of code and execute them with
the mouse and a keypress. The whole time you're doing this, the renderer is
doing it's thing, so it's usable live.

One day I'd like to make the code editor a quake style console thingy, so the
code is visible to all, on top of the 3D. Figuring out the interface for this
is a bit more tricky, but I guess it could work in a similar fashion.

Surely it'd be the Luddites (non-programmers) rioting?

That would be quite a gig.

weaving as performance art? 

my mum used to have this massive floor loom in our house. I think she was the
first generative art programmer I met :)

maybe there should be attempts to make performance weaving more 
interesting by somehow freeing the performer from having to start at 
one end and moving line by line. Maybe we should consider sewing - it 
also uses foot control.

yes I agree that generative art programming performance is primarily 
a domestic activity.

if programming becomes very easy then the salaries of a programmer

cool! i hope to get its visuals more varied and a bit more controllable by

now it has a frequent tendency to look a bit too much like a bad knockoff
of a mark napier piece. but hopefully won't be too much work to give it a 
bit more variety. 

and i can't wait to see feedback.pl in action!

hmm, that really pushes/questions the definition of a feedback loop
doesn't it!  everything could be a feedback loop - feedback between a
person and the world... kind of existential...
 
but this brings me to a couple philsophical/practical live coding
questions i ran into while working on the Thingee. Thingee is written in
lingo, so at first i started just typing lingo commands on the screen for
what i wanted to do. then i noticed, the commands were in some cases 
uncomfortably long; i had a tendency to mistype, forget syntax, etc. 
so i did what i would do in a "normal" application of course - write my 
own routines. then i can type shorter commands. 

ok, so now, is that still "live coding"? because by this line of thinking, 
i could just assign a keypress rather than typing the name of my routine. 
then it wouldn't seem like live coding at all. 

so this reminds me of the fact that using and programming are really a 
continuum when you get down to it... every language is a piece of software 
running on top of machine language; every programmer is a user of the 
language in which they're programming... 

so where do we draw the line? number of keystrokes seems not to be a 
productive way to think about it. i looked through the wiki and the paper 
draft, and sort of found this all being questioned but not quite answered, 
which is probably a Good Thing, because in my gut i think there's not an 
answer. the gist seems to be writing algorithms in live performance: but 
then again, we're almost always starting from algorithms that exist. for 
example, if i want an object to start continuously rotating, i could write 
in lingo 
 sprite(3).rotation = sprite(3).rotation + 10

but typing "rot" or "rot 3" or "rot 3 10" would be preferable. can i 
predefine a "rot" routine or do i have to actually write it while i'm on 
stage? requiring it 
to be written on stage seems to me to privilege the existing language 
(lingo) too much as the basis from which everything must spring. and 
"rotation" is a pre-existing algorithm anyway. 

this example may be too simple to illustrate the dilemma effectively, but 
imagine it was something more complex, involving screengrabs, a for loop, 
and some other transformations perhaps... 

in my gut i feel like this is like the "what is interactivity" question
from a few years ago. and the answer is, "admit there isn't any, but 
don't let that stop you from doing it." with interactivity there was a 
myth that the artist was giving away control of the piece to the user - 
but in fact,
the artist was still in control. with live-coding, there is a myth that
the performer is in control of the software/music/images - but in fact,
he's still being controlled. and yet, once we see through the myth,
there's nothing inherently bad about interactivity per se, and now that
all the controversy's died down, it's often used quite well and without
much fanfare in projects even by folks who decried its existence - just
for what it is - giving the user some physical participation in a project
without claiming to give him "control." the same might be true with live
coding - perhaps it's important to recognize that live coding just moves
the program along the scale of participation between user and CPU, but
there's many levels of control in between. (and that even at the "user"  
level, it's possible to take an unexpected degree of control, just as at
the programmer level it's more than possible to lose it.) what do you
think?

i also have a more directly practical question, but i think i will put 
that in reply to nick's post...

ok, so here's my 2-part question, for you and alex and everyone:

1) how do you go about telling the interpreter "execute now" when live 
coding? dave, you're using highlighting? does it execute as soon as you 
highlight? or you have to hit RETURN or something? 

i'm for now using the semicolon (which lingo does not use) to indicate 
to lingo "execute this now!" but i'm wondering if there's a better way 
than using a character or even RETURN within the "editor" - since any of 
these are subject to typos, and then i have to delete it to edit the 
line to make it do something else, and sometimes i forget and it tries to 
execute an incomplete line of code. 
i realize this will vary with the livecoding methodology being used, but 
just curious how others are doing this.

2) validation - i make typos when livecoding, and then the illegal 
commands generate a 
nasty crash or at least an error in performance! i may just integrate 
those into the performance, but, curious how others handling this problem? 
are you having some code validation go on before execution, or... ???

thx!

actually one of my grad students is doing a project involving using a 
knitting machine for programming. although she's aware of the long history 
of programming and even computer hardware to textile production, it seems 
her main impetus is just that she's a long-time knitter. she also did a 
project a few months back in which she displayed knit swatches along with the 
corresponding knitting instructions as code. it turns out, knitting 
instructions actually are code anyway:

1st and every alt rows: P (on wrong side)
2nd row: K1, *k1, k2 tog, yo, k1, yo, ssk, k2, rep from * to end
4th row: K1, *k2 tog, yo, k3, yo, ssk, k1, rep from * to end.
6th row: K2 tog, * yo, k5, yo, sk2p, rep from * to last 7 sts, yo, k5, yo, 
ssk.

I have Perl recompile the whole file I'm editing all the time.  State is
preserved - it's just interpreting it as an extra bit of code, except
old versions of sub-routines get replaced with real ones.

I have two modes...  One is to have the interpreter run over the code
every time I type any key, or every time the running program edits its
own code.  This mode is of course completely impractical as you have to
think of the effect of every single keypress.  It also uses a lot of
CPU, so I can't keep many running at a time without getting audio
drop-outs...  This is because my programs tend to edit their code a lot,
putting in comments to let me know what's going on.

The other mode triggers a recompile every time I hit ctrl-x.  This seems
to work for me.

My code first tries to compile it into a scratch area first, so that if
the program isn't syntactically correct it leaves the old version
running.

I don't know Adorno's argument, but...

On one hand, sourcecode exists as a set of instructions, and running
code exists as the sourcecode being processed.  When the sourcecode is
being processed within a stable operating system, the results can be
pre-determined.  Every time you run the code, you get the same results.

When live coding, when you describe an instruction, it is carried out
immediately.  In linguistic terms, this suggests the language of the
live programmer is performative.  In general life, if you say that the
cat is blue, you don't make it so.  When live coding, by declaring that
$cat = "blue";, then $cat == "blue"; immediately becomes true.

But then, perhaps this is an illusion, because I have power over a
certain scope.  I might tell myself that cats are blue and believe it. 
I might tell my computer the same thing, it has no reason to doubt me, I
am its true master.  But if I try to tell someone elses computer that
cats are blue, I would fail - I probably don't have enough authority
over that computer to make it so.

But then (again), any performative use of language is a matter of power
within a scope.  A king can say "my shoes must be here," but that will
only become true if a loyal subject is within earshot.  A jury may say
"You are guilty" in a court of law, but they lose that power once they
leave.

So, to read code is to execute it.  Saying one is more important than
the other is to draw a false separation.  And unread code is less useful
than code that has been read.

I'm not sure if there is such a difference as far as we're concerned. 
Experimental scores of this era seem very similar to computer programs.

... to performance, yes.  These three elements that you mention seem
essential to music performance, and live programming allows them to be
brought to the fore.

I think the latter.  To say that the same piece of music is ever heard
twice is to belittle the role of the listener who listens differently
with each play.

I would encourage Amy to get involved- if you don't have time, I can try to 
work in your comments from this list without corrupting them and you could 
double check. It is great to have a visual live coding perspective, and 
you're challenging our assumptions; I particularly enjoyed the 20/5/04 
2.26pm posting.

I will make a draft attempt at describing some live coding projects soon, 
hoping to take in ChucK, the Hamburg symposium, Alex's new system, my draft 
setup and I hope Amy will write about hers too (you already did on this 
list so that can be quickly adapted, plus add a screenshot...). We can also 
attempt to link in further projects- fluxus etc. Dave, you didn't design 
this for performance and you haven't used this live, you're just claiming 
you could and would like to soon? : )

Oh yes, and a manifesto draft- even if people don't have time to be

There is freedom for the live coder to determine the language of their

Subject: [livecode] validation/typos


In SuperCollider we type enter rather than return to execute a 
line/selection. Hard to do accidentally in my experience. If there are 
syntax errors, there's an error message and you can correct.

If we type legit syntax but there are errors, say

myObject.undefinedMethod

then there will be some crashing halt of that task, which doesn't mean the 
audio output is necessarily affected. Crashes vary in how awful they are 
depending on what you're coding.

Reset of SC via recompile or via restart of prog in OS X can take from 2 to 
20 sec; almost like a break between songs in a standard band's set!

Julian has attempted to write some validation code to cover possible 
problems; in general this is impossible due to our friend the Halting 
Problem. Like word processor spell checking, context may not be picked up 
on, and the algorithm may be entirely runnable, just not about to do what 
you thought you had coded due to user misassumptions. The elusive human 
understanding of abstract operations is in full play- the heroic 
intellectual side to this live coding game...

Subject: Re: vislivecode slightly ot rambles (was Re: [livecode] another


thanks nick and all for your comments!

the Thingee is making some progress! 
rough preliminary screengrabs at http://thebot.org/lcgrabs/

well it may be getting a little *too* pretty now, but it's usually quite 
a bit goofier when you see it move. and of course, since you're seeing it 
respond to the code as i type it in, it has that livecode appeal that you 
can't see in the stills...  i think i've got the exception 
handling worked out now so it doesn't crash when i type illegal code in.
however, there's still plenty of room for me to make a fool of myself in 
performance, as i occasionally type things by accident that make the 
code-boxes go whizzing around out of my control and then i have to try to 
"catch" one to make it stop. (i am working on a "panic button" 
implementation - but of course it's much more entertaining if i at least 
*try* to catch them... :-) )

some more details: there are currently 6 code-boxes (editors) on the
screen, plus two buffers which can take images of the app or the whole 
screen for feedback purposes ... the idle loop will execute the code in 
any or all of the code-boxes that end with a semicolon at a given moment. 
you can type a one line command or
a many line snippet in each box (assuming enough space - the box will
expand, up to a point. of course, you can type some code to make the font
smaller, and that would give you more room.) i migh try a ctrl-something 
like alex is doing, which would seem logical... but given that there's 6 
boxes the semicolon might actually be easier because you can be sure of 
which one is
going to be affected. also, it's kind of neat visually because the code
takes effect as soon as you type the semicolon.  thinking of alex and
geoff's discussion of performative speech and performative code - it's
kind of neat (i think) to see the *semicolon* actually perform what it 
does!  (and also will be a funny inside joke to people who know that lingo 
doesn't use semicolons like all those "difficult" languages. :-) )

as to the shortcut/longhand thing - as i guess nick was alluding to - i'm 
working it out as i go along. :-) sometimes it makes sense to type it 
all out, but for certain stuff, it's just too much - so shortcuts become 
essential... the discerning screengrab viewer may 
note the beginnings of a custom shortcut grammar beginning, based on my 
personal tendency toward verbification: therefore, the following commands 
exist in ThingeeLanguage: smallify, rotify, skewify, colorify, bigify and 
biggify (because i cannot seem to spell that one consistently). there are 
some other commands too that don't match that convention - i'll probably  
go back and "ify" them too. 

well, there is still some work to do on it, but then again, i guess it 
doesn't need to be done til august so should be plenty of time to get it 
ready for r+d camp... 

thanks for all your feedback (pun intended),

Yep, you have to hit F5 - in maya it's the enter key on the keypad, but on a
laptop (which I have) that's more tricky :)

If no code is selected, hitting F5 will execute the whole script BTW.

Also in fluxus you can set a bit of code that's called each frame - if you
make this a function call, you can modify the function, highlight and execute
the scheme function definition again, and it will update live.

I also made a simple gui (sorry ;)) that just consists of buttons that execute
code snippets (again, usually function calls, but it can be whatever you want)
Again, you can build this simple gui live, or load it from prebuilt scripts.

As long as you don't stop running the visuals, script errors should not be a

No crashes. Well, that's the idea anyway - I keep everything really simple, I
have a few issues with the physics library (which is superb in other respects:
http://www.ode.org/) but I've got them mostly under control now. 

For script errors the lower area of the window spews them out. with scheme
it's mostly mismatching (((()))) so I added parentheses highlighting in the
editor which makes it miles easier.

I worried a lot about doing something like this, but in practise it hasn't
been much of a problem, if there is a syntax error in a script the interpreter
aborts the code there and it's quite easy to sort out. The only thing that
seems to go wrong is if the code generates a mismatching (push) or (pop)
trashing the renderer's state stack - but this often results in visually
interesting ;) results anyway...

DJ auditioning for live coders...

If I ever get a soundcard with spare outputs I'll set up preview mode for 
new live coded audio objects before they get switched into the main output. 
At the moment I can control if they turn up with fader down, pause on.

But Alex already seems to be heading into the territory of new spawned 
processes run in a controlled space before commitment...I look forward 
increasingly to seeing this beast in action...

Hi all,

A coupla questions...

Where do you stand on the use of genetic programming for performance? Is this
under the same category as live coding - the difference being that you grow
the code rather than write it?

Also, what is the definition of code? Is it text only, what about graph based
languages? (max/msp, pd, modular synths - or even UML?) They can often be
appreciated more by a non programmer audience, and look pretty to boot.

cheers,

*snip*

This sounds like the best call for me to make some noise. :)

I'm spending a lot of time at the moment with trying to work out a
nice way of handling reparsing after every keystroke. One hope of
this is that a chain could be established to avoid having to make
a key press to refresh. The aim would be to reduce the effect of
each key press because:

	XXXX only disturbs the lexer when a character changes.

	The lexer only disturbs the parser when a token is changed.

	The parser only disturbs YYY when the parse tree is error
	free.

In this way errors don't get propogated along the compiler pipeline
and hopefully edits which don't change tokens will get done localy
by the lexer and nothing else will be disturbed.

I have not got any good test data (any suggestions for per character
edit logs of source files) but the current code would seem to be
reasonably fast, of course parsing seems to me like the easy part of
incremental compilation.

Cheers,
Rob.

the idea of a fetish is very much connected to the idea of having a 
total control over an isolated entity. I wonder if the separation of 
score and music played has in itself a certain fetishism. Most 
composers hear the music when they write it and many musicians see 
the score when they improvise.
A certain fetishism is perhaps the eurocentristic concepts behind the 
ideas connected to tonality and in this respect the notation system 
has its role for sure. Also regarding the role of musician and 
composer (maybe not dissimilar to those of theoretican and 
practician) I would consider this.

this reminds me of the discussion that was going on in parisian 
surrealist circles about film. For Luis Bu=F1uel, for example, the art 
of film was the perfect way of showing the dream logic of the real 
world. So what you say about assignment could lead to a view towards 
programming that shows this activity as an artform connected to the 
unconcious. I suggest cadavre exquis circles in code, as well as

yes the idea of a certain environment that represents a certain 
causality which is somehow arbitrary but consistent in itself is very 
much related to programming. I always wonder how to make this

There is an interesting aspect in this: people think live activity is 
not deterministic. So the causes and effects of what happens in music 
is very important to how the music is percieved. Generally a very 
common question confronting an artwork has become less 'what should 
it express?' than 'is this happening by chance or on purpose?'. But 
this is bound to lead to a much broader discussion.

Ah, I think this is the distinction, it can still be interactive - you
can choose code that produces good results manually, while you perform,
"navigate the geneome space" if you want to be academic about it...

Genetic programs should be shown more, they tend to get hidden away by

Heh!

So shall I combine the authors of the last article (Ade, Julian, Nick
and I), with those others active on the list (Amy, Dave, Geoff)?  Quite
a few authors!  

Olga needs to know by the end of the weekend.  It's just to put a list
of papers up on the site and in promotion - we can change the list of
authors later as we wish.  Having signatories as well as authors sounds
a good idea.  This will be quite a historical document I think.

I edited the name of the paper to "Live algorithmic performance and a
temporary organisation for its promotion."  It was "Live audio
programming ..." before, but clearly we need to include visual
programming to now!  We should probably have a few alternative names for
it...

Right, I'm off to Pescara for my first live coding gig!  I haven't had
any time to prepare, so I don't know what's going to happen.  Exciting!

what I meant is that I would try to avoid to define live coding by a 
concept of interactivity that is widely criticised. Like a book is an 
extremely interactive medium as you can read it in so many ways. So 
I'd quote Alex on this, as he wrote:
>To say that the same piece of music is ever heard
>twice is to belittle the role of the listener who listens differently
>with each play

this means that interactivity itself cannot be the means to define live coding.

as this makes it hard then to define live coding then, I would 
suggest two properties that, so to say, can be of help for 
orientation (this is totally open to dicussion).

- a program which does not appear as a tool for something else
- a program that is being read and written  while using it and where 
the readability/changeability is relevant.

From: Fredrik Olofsson <f

hi amy, rest,
curious to see your setup.  checking those screenshots as sending this.

let me brag a little below (not)...
i did a disasterous gig exactly a year ago in the south of sweden using 
something similar.  one and only time i had my now defunct 
supercollider2 redFrik livecoding framework running which was er... 
more about routing sounds through effects, changing tempo, fading 
in/out things with a syntax interface - not true livecoding.  it just 
looked cool.
in the background i had my max/nato videopatch and it grabbed a small 
area of the screen.  whatever was in that area got passed through 2-3 
effects, scaled up to fullscreen and sent to the beamer.  the 
trashing/pixelating video effects were in turn controlled by parameters 
in the music (iirc tempo and drumfile loopingpoints (bbcut info)).  so 
the code was visually transformed in sync with the sound.
it was a big event and i screwed up totally.  didn't rehears due to 
coding to the last minute and my brain went into schimpansee mode as 
always when performing.  couldn't keep all things in my head 
controlling both video and music so both stagnated for long periods of 
time while i tried to think clear.  add to that the projector was crap 
and my video effects possibly a little too brutal so the mess was 
totally unreadable :-(  me still shivers when thinking about it.  so i 
figured i need to start rehearse livecoding on a daily basis as any 
instrument and also fully automate certain things (like the video part) 
and that's where i'm still at.

my framework did have one nice feature tho.  a command like filling a 
pattern with 60% random hits could be undone with the revert n steps 
command.
o.send("/punkBassdrum/patAmp",16,0.6);		//fill with new
o.send("/punkBassdrum/patAmp",\revert,1);	//go back to previous if bad
or similar filling a pattern with random pitches between 20 and 60.  
with revert i could jump back to good sounding patterns.  just needed 
to remember which index was good sounding -sigh.
o.send("/punkBassdrum/patPitch",16,20,60);
o.send("/punkBassdrum/patPitch",\revert,1);

no cure for the halting problem but having safe positions, in this case 
good sounding settings, to retreat back to as you branch out i think is 
vital.  like a mountain climber at regular intervals drilling for firm 
stops.  and these couldn't be prepared in advance - they're made up as 
you go.

I wanted to get more into synthesis and so bought a couple of curtis
roads books, began to learn SuperCollider and wrote a Perl library for
sending OSC commands to it, with timestamps for nice precision.  So I'm
just using it to render the sound, like you suggested to me in Hamburg.

I read some of the curtis roads book while on holiday but haven't got
that far, so I'm using a simple and dodgy patch for synthesis that I
don't understand.  I managed to write a sampler patch for loading
playing wavs after being surprised not to find a demo patch for that.

It works nicely although I haven't worked out how to limit the number of
simulatanious voices yet so I can push it a bit too far sometimes.  I
can share the source when I get home if you're interested.

I'll write a report of my performace in Pescara soon.

I am very short of time and my eyes fall close every minute currently.
I would like to make additions, but I have no idea where this is productive.

for me I see a slight problem in the definition of the term live programming.
I have never thought that it is restricted to performance situations. 
I wouldn't mind at all, as 'live coding' could be set against 
'interactive programming' or such terms, but as our organisation is 
dedicated to live programming, it does matter somehow. I think the 
performer-audience separation as something I would try to break up by 
live programming, and not reassure it.

Anyway, if you can give me a hint where additions to the paper is 
welcome, please tell me.

best,
Julian

Please could you give some examples if your eyes fall open; you've spoken 
before of playing off stage.

where is the importance of 'now' in such actions? Does just listening 
always leads to someone asking about the nature of what they hear and get 
us back into trouble?

interactive programming solo is prototyping/practise? Composition, not 
improvisation under real-time constraints.

I don't want to cause schism but I would fear a diluting of message if we 
did an either or case on performance perhaps; depends how couched. Please 
feel free to suggest anything to resolve this!

(I've tried already to avoid out and out 'look at the virtuoso typer' stuff 
but its hard not to talk up the intellectual appreciation of algorithm. Any 
other tacks we could take?)

just a thought; i've had similar feelings about the improvisiational 
"realtime" nature of coding at home at times, which audiences for a work 
(performance work or not) can't experience, and my actual livecoding 
performance, if i perform the Thingee, probably won't be at all like that 
- it will be more concerned with outward performance than inward... alex's 
"hacking sound in context" paper i think captures that vibe well... 

i'm rambling cause in a rush, but i mean: if we explain the visceral
immediacy of programming that occurs when programming non-performatively
as a starting off point, that may help cover this aspect of livecoding
while also providing readers an important insight, esp. to
non-programmers, into why we think livecoding is so meaningful.

i will also try to make some edits soon to my section. shall we also note 
where are sections are derived from email discussion? i would prefer that 
people not think i would write in such a rambling, incoherent manner for a 
formal paper (even though that may also be true :-). 

btw, how are we doing on time? i'm trying to take it easy on typing these 
next couple days - arm's a bit sore from tetanus shot...

This seems key, I think we need to make this point in the paper.  Can
you explain more?  I think you mean that live programming isn't just
what you do when you have an audience, but also making music alone. 
That the sense of engaging with live programming is the same as engaging
with live electricity.  I think this is a subtley different to the sense
of performing live to an audience, which also applies, but you can work
on electricity alone.  Is this a distinction you would make, or do I
misunderstand?

How can live coding help break performer-audience separation?

I think the choice to use live programming is simply an interface choice -
scripts are user interfaces as much as anything else. More importantly though,
they are a very rigorous description of what is going on, more so than a load
of graphics - and a bit more honest.

The reason that it might be better for a performer-audience situation may be
due to this honesty - not patronising the audience and hiding the process away
behind a ton of graphics, and not having that stupid secrecy that seems to be
so common in computer art generally - like by giving away the details of the
processes used, the artists may lose something. 

The processes used in computer art are just as individual and unique as the
result (sadly often more interesting:), and they should be open for all to
see. A performance that is open and honest in this way is a story, and much
more engaging for it - I lose count of the number of bands I've seen with
laptops "live" and come away feeling a little empty and cheated.

cheers for listening to my little rant :)

I am writing a proposal for a research project in which i reference

If you have references about interaction with programs using code, 
preferably in the context of culture science and informatics, this 
could help me a lot. Maybe there is something that hasn't been 
mentioned yet, which would help me a lot.

I will refer to the active artists who contributing here and to the 
sources that were mentioned in the last paper, but I am expected to 
find more and older reseach papers if there are. If we are really so 
original in our attempts, well that is good, but I guess we have more

I would say that doing live programming alone, I am the audience and 
programmer in one, which is not a trivial unity, but a quite 
heterogeneous one, in which the language, my expectations, my 
perceptions, errors and my poetic and/or programming style play their 
own roles. The situation with one or more persons as audience, or, 
not to forget, as coperformers, is an interesting extension of this 
situation, but it is by no means primary. There are many specific 
problems of this larger interaction, such as readablility performance 
style etc. which are well worth discussing, but I would not constrain 
interactive programming to this specific public situation.
For the film "Alles was wir haben" this was the situation that was 
responsible for how the whole idea worked and it was what I did while 
working on jitlib. I could describe the compositional work I did more 
in details, but maybe this is already a general description of a type 
of situation which I find very interesting in itself.

>
>How can live coding help break performer-audience separation?

In my experience it allows a very spontaneous interaction with the 
music in combination with talking about the music. This means I can, 
while playing, talk with others about what they hear, think, etc. or 
about other topics even and as the sound keeps playing I can react to 
these conversations by changing the code. Then I am not in the 
situation of the one who is looked at (especially as it is not my 
body movements which are so interesting, hmhm..) but the code / sound 
relation is in the center of attention. Of course, one step further, 
in networked live coding there is a flow of code between all 
participants which can, to different degrees, interact and 
contribute. Nobody knows who does what anyways.

I think the term 'performance' is not needed in a definition.
*
Live coding is the activity of writing (parts of) a program while it runs.
It thus deeply connects the algorithmic causality with the resulting 
perceptions and by deconstructing the idea of the temporal dichotomy 
of tool and product it allows to bring into play code as an artistic 
process.

hm, wondering if my text has any relevance what so ever.  it's crap and 
better be left out.  perhaps it'd fit if we decide to do the second part of 
the paper as suggested 'current discussions from the mailinglist'.  but i'll 
look through and give it a go tonight.  maybe i can come up with something 
better.  else dump it i say.


other comments on the text.

"exploring the art of coding in live performance" etc. and alex: "How can 
live coding help break performer-audience separation?"
i agree with julian that there's an unfortunate basis towards the live-in-
front-of-an-audience performance situation in the text.  maybe should we try 
to find another word?  maybe 'performace' here should be read more like 'the 
performance _art_ of live coding'.  what i'm trying to say is that the art 
direction/genre called 'performance art' or 'aktion kunst' might be 
something to refer to and perhaps soften this audience separation issue a 
bit.  judging from the performances i've experienced there is generally a 
much looser aim, purpose, finished work or genius to put on a pillar.  often 
the audiences is provoked to take part in the piece but at least not sit 
still and watch/listen.  it's most often ongoing processes that you can 
witness for a little while - stay or leave, come and go.  many even not 
meant to or impossible to follow from beginning to the end.
a little addition (introduction - in the middle) to try to catch some of the 
above...
"So live coding allows the exploration of abstract algorithm spaces as an 
intellectual improvisation + and by revealing, provoking and challenging the 
audience with the bare bone syntax, hopefully make them follow along or even 
take part in the expedition."
see it as a suggestion.  i don't have the english chops to do it i'm afraid.  
besides you may all disagree :-)

i've looked at doing livecoding from a shell (python maybe) which seems more 
practical than sc's text editor (simple things like arrow-up to edit and 
redo your last command = heavens!) but then i'm not keen on implementing the 
whole timing, threads and tasks thing myself.  also had ideas about building 
my own text interpreter in sc (based on julian's DocumentArea?) but it seems 
like the Document class is too limited for that atm.

perhaps irrelevant and only personal hookups but i'm having trouble with the 
way supercolliders [mac] text editor works.  i think it promotes select, 
copy&paste code plus a lot of unnecessary mousework in between.  what do you 
say nick, julian, adc?  me think this is bad as you tend to just reuse 
snippets of code and not changing it - at least not in drastic ways.  also 
there's a lack of feedback when you evaluate something.  sc just posts some 
useless info in a status window by default.  jitlib is a little bit better 
often giving you an overview of proxies at hand but still long way from 
satisfactory.  i've noticed a great difference in outcome if i force myself 
to do a jitlib session without copy&paste of code.  often worse sounding :-( 
but that's only a question of practice i hope.
how do you deal with this alex?  do you have a library of code to copy&paste 
from?  and do you have some visual representation of processes running?  or 
are they more or less always in the form of ascii graphics?

think we haven't had a proper discussion yet about this basic tool we all 
share... the code editor or command line.

If I had more refs I would have put them in the paper; I suspect there must 
be some (non computer based) live algorithm redecision in a few live text 
pieces/happenings of the 60s. Don't know any specific example, and it may 
be particularly hard to find any case where this was a continuous act of 
overt recomposition, or made public as it was decided.

There are probably tenuous artistic precednets as always, which you can

Maybe we should design a general use OSC server that looks after the
timing at some point, and allows switching between languages and
livecode environments.  Unless something like that already exists?

> how do you deal with this alex?  do you have a library of code to copy&paste

No...  I just start with a routine called:

sub bang {
}

... which gets called every 'tick'.  To trigger a synth noise I do
something like

    $self->play({num      => 140 + $tune->[$self->{bangs} % @$tune], 
                 formfreq => 9, 
                 bwfreq   => 7,
                 ts       => 3 + rand(30)
                }
               );

to trigger a sample I do


      $self->trigger({sample  => '/slub/samples/drum/drum5.wav', 
                      pan     => 0.4,
                      ts      => 10, 
                      crackle => 100 + rand(50)
                     });

Well, most often I start with an existing sourcefile, change it a lot
and save it as something else.

> and do you have some visual representation of processes running?  or

With the live coding I just have the editor and that's it.  The only
feedback is by the process editing its sourcecode...  Changing values
directly in the source and adding comments to indicate the state of the
process.

However after my first live coding gig I'm doubting whether this is
really interesting for people to look at unless they know Perl.  There
was not much reaction when I did live coding, but when I ran my ascii
art dancing man script, some people whooped.

But then there's no reason why an ascii man or woman can't dance all
over some sourcecode...  Somehow I think more movement has to be exposed
anyway.  Static source doesn't seem to be enough on its own.

Subject: Re: [livecode] q for a


well i haven't seen your livecoding gig, alex, but i've seen your onscreen
command line stuff in helsinki and your live-programming demo in berlin,
so i have some thoughts (and also, this is one of my favorite issues and
foci of my projects: kinetics in computer - or any - performance). so,
some thoughts (sorry if i'm a bit incoherent - i'm intermittently groggy
all week from apparently a slightly harsh reaction to a tetanus shot of
all things...):

anyway, re:
"Somehow I think more movement has to be exposed anyway.  Static source 
doesn't seem to be enough on its own." 

but how about static source in motion? for example, in your berlin demo, 
it got a great reaction, but it wasn't the code itself most people were 
interested in, but the action of you generating it live. of course - this 
can lead to the old problem of the focus of livecoding appearing to be 
typing virtuosity, and what happens to the programmer who's a slow typist?  
but for me, these are exactly the things that are interesting to work 
with. (in both extreme whitespace and cyberspaceland, i try to make the 
typing and/or its onscreen results kinetic without actually requiring 
myself to have onstage typing proficiency, but again, those projects are 
really about physical kinetics not coding.) 

also, your slub performance in helsinki with ade and the onscreen bash
shell was also visually great, because from the one-line commands (am i
remembering correctly?) the audience could get a sense that interaction
with code was going on, but also, it was kinetic - to see the commands fly
by on the screen and then hear the music change. when the
ascii-dancing-man came on, it was like icing on the cake. so seeing the
onscreen command line stuff in motion was really quite performative, even
for people who were non-programmers. i'm guessing you might be finding
that harder to do with text editors and source code onscreen - then again,
your feedback.pl sounds like a great approach to kinetic code-writing, at
least as much as i can understand from reading about it; i can't wait to
see it in action!

but what else can/should we do about the static/kinetic conondrum? i have
to admit, though i think he's got a flawed argument, i can understand
where the guy was coming from who wrote that laptop performance shouldn't
be an excuse for programmers to get onstage. i have written similar
things, but not about programmers, but about the change in performance and
leisure culture in general since tools of business (computers) became
tools of entertainment and leisure. it's boring to watch most laptop
performance because it looks just like someone doing database programming.  
(i sometimes imagine that the performer *is* doing database programming to
pick up some side money and actually is playing prerecorded sound files.) 
 
but i don't think the problem is computers; the problem is that the same
models for their use have followed them over from the business world.
that's also, i think, why the LAN-game parlors that have sprung up in all
the malls here look like offices, with throngs of teenage boys sitting
quietly in rows of cubicles as they play. the first time i saw one, i
thought it was an SAT prep center.

now, the thing is, like the neocubist calvin,
http://cocicy.envy.nu/other/CalvinNeoCubist.jpg
i can see (too?) many sides to this issue:

i played music as a kid, violin/guitar/bass/drums/etc, and even was
briefly a music performance major in college. but never was much for
composition. and i never performed computer music; i don't think they had
invented computers back then. ;-) ... then later i made films and
eventually did realtime analog video stuff (which was back to
performance), then on to various static computer and programming
endeavors, and then finally to the computer performance stuff out of
frustration with sitting still programming. but in the process of being
frustrated with the loss of physical movement, i also picked up on the
kinetics of the programming process in my head, just like everyone on this
list has obviously.

so, as we've already said, livecoding is a way to bring the performance in 
our heads out to the audience. but - as alex asks, (and i think we've 
mentioned these here onlist before too): do they have to be 
programmers to relate to it? if bringing the intellectual performative 
element to the audience is the point, are we compromising it with flying 
text editors, windmill typing, fast-moving text, or dancing ascii 
people? or are these kinetic hooks necessary for non-specialized 
audiences? can we attack both at once?  

my personal answers: well, my work isn't so much about livecoding per se 
but more about addressing the juxtaposition of computer culture and 
performance, so i don't feel personally conflicted when i go for 
the clearly kinetic (on-screen or physical) stuff. but i do think both can 
be attacked at once, as alex and ade's bash shell performances have shown. 
and that kind of performance is the natural way of performing the slub 
instrument, so i personally find it beautiful in itself.. i am not sure 
the ascii man dancing across code would be quite as "pure" because he'd be 
constructed to be amusing and not a natural way to perform. however, i 
could be wrong about that, and in any case, i think he could be cool at 
least at occasional moments, again as icing on a cake that is already 
there... 

and also, as i think we've mentioned before - almost anyone can appreciate
watching a violinist perform. but audience members who also play the
violin also appreciate the performance on another level.

I guess our deadline is this evening- Alex, you want me to compile a 
finished RTF tonight? Is there an e-mail address to send it to?

I imagine a flurry of last minute maneouvres...

I hope most things in the paper now get people's approval. I guess I'd 
leave the manifesto signitories implicit now since almost everyone is an 
author by this stage.

We're probably over 25000 characters due to recent additions but I hope

Nick,

The following section doesn't fit in the section on feedback.pl, as it
is a general point.  I'll remove it, but feel free to integrate it
elsewhere if it fits usefully.


Terms such as "generative music" and "processor music" have been
invented and appropriated to describe this new perspective on
composition. Much is made of the alleged properties of so called
"generative music" that separate the composer from the resulting work.
Brian Eno likens making generative music to sowing seeds that are left
to grow, and suggests we give up control to our processes, leaving
them to "play in the wind."

This is only one approach to combining software with music, one that
this paper wishes to counter quite strongly. We advocate the
humanisation of generative music, where code isn't left alone to
meander through its self-describing soundscape, but is hacked
together, chopped up and moulded to make live music.

Here is my replacement "feedback.pl" section.  I hope it reads ok, I'm a
bit close to it at the moment.  It's crying out for an illustration, but
I haven't got the resources or the time at the moment...

feedback.pl

A painter, Paul Klee, moves to make a mark on a canvas. Immediately
after this initial moment the first counter motion occurs; that of
receptivity, as the painter sees what he has painted. Klee therefore
controls whether what he has produced so far is good.

This is the artistic process described by Klee in his excellent
Pedagogical Sketchbook [Klee, 1968].  The same process occurs when an
artist edits a computer program.  The artist types an algorithm into
the computer, the artist considers it in its place and moves to make
the next mark in response.

However, live programming allows us to play with this relationship
somewhat.  Let me describe how my live programming environment,
'feedback.pl' works.

The marks that the artist is making in feedback.pl don't just affect
the artist, but also affect the running code.  While the artist
considers the possibilities of a fresh algorithm that they have just
typed, feedback.pl is already executing it.

What's more, the algorithm running in feedback.pl can edit its source
code.  I should explain carefully...  While the artist types in a
computer program, feedback.pl is running it; that running process may
edit its own source code.  Those self-modifications take immediate
effect, changing the running program.  And so it goes on.

The running code may also do other things.  I use feedback.pl as an
environment to make music.  So I write live code in feedback.pl that
makes live music.

And so we have at least three complementary feedback loops.  One loop
is that of the artist and their work in progress - expressions enter
the program, the artist observes the effect on the sourcecode and
reacts with further expressions.  A second loop is that between the
sourcecode and the running process - the process reads the sourcecode
and carries out instructions which modify the sourcecode, then reads
in its modifications and follows those.

The third, outer feedback loop appears when the program creates
external output.  The program might generate some sounds that the
artist interprets as music, reacts to by changing the sourcecode,
immediately changes the process which in turn alters the generated
sound, which the artist reacts to once more.

When I'm performing before a live audience, then there is a fourth
feedback loop, encompassing the audience who are interpreting the
music in their own individual ways, making their own artistic
expressions by dancing to it, which affects the choices I make, in
turn changing the music.

If the programmer is to share the continuous artistic process of a
painter, their performative movements must be must be reactive, they
must be live.  Code must be interpreted by the computer as soon as it
can be written, and the results reacted to as soon as they can be
experienced.  The feedback loops must be complete.

Date: Tue, 1 Jun 2004 18:21:07 +0100


Hi all,

A little report on livecoding lsystem descriptions of melodies. 

I'm not sure this is manefesto compliant or even counts as code, but I've
recently got a simple livecoding thing going on in some of my music software.
You basically enter the axiom and rules of an lsystem which are then expanded
as the melody is playing.

There is a simple score language the lsystem produces where:
o = note on
+ = up one note (the exact frequency change is configured elsewhere)
- = down one note
! = reset to root note
. = rest one beat

and numeric tokens are used as rule replacements for the lsystem.

so:

axiom = 1
rule '1' = o+1-1

expands to:

generation 1: o+o+1-1-o+1-1
generation 2: o+o+o+1-1-o+1-1-o+o+1-1-o+1-1
generation 3: o+o+o+o+1-1-o+1-1-o+o+1-1-o+1-1-o+o+o+1-1-o+1-1-o+o+1-1-o+1-1

well, you get the idea (just basic lsystem search/replace) :)

the results are actually quite nice, and playing it live feels pretty much
like programming to me. simple rules expand into quite complex melodies
quickly. I've used this lsystem score idea before, but in a genetic
programming environment where you had a choice of lsystem rules to breed from
- but doing it by hand is more satisfying (if a little slower)

cheers,

dave

They have cellular automata in there as well, I've been playing with them too
- live coding CA's in my system consist of flipping rule bits on and off though.

There is a lot of genetic searching going on in that system (is that OSCAR?).
>From the screenshots it looks like you can search quickly for acceptable
results, and then tweak the system by hand if need be.

That paper looks damn interesting, I'll have to read it through properly when
I get time.

As an aside, something I've been thinking about recently is that most
livecoding seems to consist of quite high level scripts (or in these cases -
rule systems). Something that may also be interesting would be lower level
code, assembly and microcode. In evolving code systems like tierra
(http://www.his.atr.jp/~ray/tierra/) we have unbreakable machine code - every
instruction is valid IIRC. Could be fun to livecode a system you can't get
wrong :)

Related to this, sort of, is the current fashion for 8bit computers -
livecoding zx spectrum basic for visuals :] anyone done this?

Nice!

My most successful attempt at making a tune is similar to this.  I just
use a two dimensional structure of +'s and -'s, and step through
structure recursively.  I'm not sure what an lsystem is, but I think my
naive approach is similar but a lot simpler.

The first bit of this recording from pescara is using live coding:
  http://nosignal.slab.org/placard/mp3s/yaxu.mp3

I lost my nerve after the first track and reverted to slub club classic
Perl scripts.

I've been on internet holiday at home, our line has been down.  It's
fixed now - will catch up with things later, like your mail Amy.

Sounds cool, but I don't understand fully... Most of my attempts at creating
melody (which work) have just consisted of sampling low frequency sine waves
for pitch and note on/off information and tweaking them to cycle patterns, but
this is getting off topic...

> I'm not sure what an lsystem is, but I think my naive approach is similar

An lsystem is really just a set of search replace rules you iteratively apply
to a string. Most of the work is in how you interpret the symbols. (good
description here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindenmayer_system) 
Branching is also important, but in this system it doesn't make use of that
for the melody.

Cool - I think I like the livecoded bit the best :) I meant to post some
lsystem music earlier but forgot:

them, I'll try recording some written from scratch soon...

I've tried to answer your mail a couple of times Amy but despite typing
a lot, there are some difficult questions you raise...

So last try I hope...

I guess as far as a performance is concerned, the idea is to focus on
what you're trying to do, and let the audience do the same.  Because
they want to see what you're doing, so they can better choose how to
relate to the output.

So if special effects help illustrate your point, or help expose invoked
movement that is otherwise invisible, then that has to be good.  Smoke
screens and other distractions are clearly not what we're aiming for
though.

The ASCII dancing man is a good example of an on-screen display that's
entertaining in its own right.  However believe it or not, he is
generating music from his little dance.  It's hard to tell because it's
pretty intense and repetitive, so I don't tend to run him on his own. 
But when his dance changes, so does the music.  When I'm playing with
him, I'm mostly thinking about the sound he's making.  So he's not a
distraction for me.  He's not really a distraction for the audience
either, because although they may not realise that he's making music,
they at least see that he's dancing in time to it, so the music still is
a focus.  Perhaps I should make him make some encouraging remark such as
"Dance you *expletive deleted*"  

So really I think that whatever happens, as long as the projection of
the interface is intrinsic to the performance - a genuine part of it
rather than a distraction or smoke screen, then it can do no harm.

I'm very much looking forward to seeing your livecode system too Amy!

Sorry, I didn't explain at all, partly because I can't remember how it
works.

This is the two dimensional structure:
   + + -                                                
   + - +
   - -
That gets rendered into something like this.
         -                   -
      - - +        -      - - +
 + - - +        - - +- - - +
  + +      + - - +    + +
            + +

By this recursive subroutine:

{
    my $count;
    sub test {
        my ($self, $value, $level) = @_;
        if (not $level) {
            $level = $count = 0;
            @score = ();
        }
        return if @$structure <= $level;

        my $substruct = $structure->[$level];
        foreach my $dir (@$substruct) {
            ++$count;
            if ($dir eq '+') {
                ++$value;
            }
            elsif ($dir eq '-') {
                --$value;
            }
            push @score, $value;
            $self->test($value, $level + 1, $count);
        }
    }
}

I think there's probably a bug but it sounds ok, but then I am cheating
by using a rather boring scale.

Hi all, 

Another, more ambitious l system melody based chunk of audio:
http://www.archive.org/download/spider-lure/spider-lure.ogg
It's 20 minutes long and as it's all improvised, its quite rambling and takes
a while for things to really start happening.
The melodies were all programmed live by creating the rules and editing them
by hand - ended up with 6 patterns triggering 6 synth voices. It takes a while
to get them going, so there is a bit of percussion noise in the background at
the start generated my other more random means - and later there some more
triggered with a 1d cellular automata.

Should we have a wiki page for links to/descriptions of livecoding
environments and maybe also one for recordings (audio or visual) of livecoded
artifacts?

Is everyone busy doing interesting things? :)

cheers,

dave

Thought a quick report on Alex and I at the Sussex Arts Club might be 
interesting...it was this Tuesday last (29th June).

We presented our tech, linux progs and feedback.pl from Alex, SuperCollider 
3 from me, plus the idea of live coding and TOPLAP itself, with one 
projector each. We performed a little too, even together near the end, 
though perhaps time constrained by a rush for trains back to London.

We certainly stirred up some feelings, and there were plenty of questions 
(and some answers) and apparently many discussions outside of the session. 
I think we found this healthy once the onslaught was underway.

Some questions were from points-scoring local academics, or those 
unfamiliar with developments in interactive generative music. The two 
tougher comments on that night (which we should have anticipated better, 
and will anticipate in future and thus circumvent):

Why don't you just use Fruity Loops to make music? Also, the musical output 
of your work could be done better as a record, preferably by people other 
than you who know what they're doing as musicians, rather than being 
programmers, you pretenders. Yes, the output is definitely not using 
anything that isn't available in commercial software.

I've noticed that the gestural content of this typing is not like the 
haptic joy I get from my musical instrument. Therefore it must be worse as 
music. And your fetishism reminds me of early music practitioners who 
insist on period instruments. (by the way, in secret I'm an electronic 
music composer, ie, this is socratic irony, but I'd like a big round of 
applause as if I'm a pure unsullied musician of the romantic era).

Obviously there is no response to either of these penetrating criticisms. 
Opinions have only been exaggerated slightly to make life seem more 
interesting than it is.

heh! and here i thought only visual computer artists had to sit through

enlightened community like musicians have... amazing! and the funny part 
is, we weren't even live coding, just using computers in our work at all 
(esp. while doing time as a computer animator) provoked essentially these

if it's of any use, one of the more constructive responses seems to be the
Photography Defense, which provides historical perspective on similar
debates over technology and art. i.e. "Did you know that when artists
first began to work with photography, painters rejected it as mechanical
and antithetical to art? It took awhile for people to understand and
appreciate the artistic possibilities of photography, and how they are
different than those of painting...." ... it gets head nods from the
computer artists, at least. :-)

Roelf Toxopeus just sent me this as corroboration that Forth live coding

I never received responses from Bischoff/Perkis on their dating of their
early livecoding performances, so I suspect Kuivila is still the prize
winner...

7)  David Rosenboom:  Systems of Judgment.  An update on David since his
days of brain-jamming with John and Yoko.  This improvised piece from uses
the computer to record sections of David's piano playing.  The computer
system alters the recording, adds new material, and sends it to another
piano, which plays the new material.  The piece is like Voyager in that it
is a duo between computer and person, where each has its own say in the
music and its own instrument to play.  The difference is that Voyager does
not record anything, but synthesizes its part on the basis of its analysis
of the input.  Rosenboom created this system using a computer languageof
his own design, called "HMSL", which was a Smalltalk-like variant of Forth,
which was the most widely used language in interactive music before the
emergence in the late 1980s of Max (created at Ircam by my UCSD colleague,
Miller Puckette).  Forth was preferred over C because of the interactive,
basically real-time compiling of program, which actually allowed you to
write programs and execute them during performance.  Making computer
programming part of a real-time, improvised performance was quite a
frequent practice during this period.

Hi,

I'm currently co-running rand()%  www.r4nd.org
which i strongly urge you all to contribute to...
anyhow, I'm quite into live coding, but as an aspect of generative systems,
in otherwords most live coding is evolutionary in its practice,
trying various combos/subroutes etc and pruning/growing chosen directions.
Generative systems are often a major aid to such coding approaches,
allowing the experimentation to occur independently within evolving/changing
subroutes etc.
So In aarhus I gues me and Joe Gilmore (my r4nd buddy) will be talking about
r4nd, about
generative composition and about performing with(in) generative systems..
oh and hopefully make some interesting noises along the way.

now... what you all up to.... and has someone ported sclang to windows yet?

Perhaps it is useful to say "Here is something that was once rejected
and is now accepted" to open minds a little, but it isn't a strong
argument - it doesn't follow that programming will be accepted later
just because it is rejected now.

Actually I think the original question was a valid one and a deserves a
direct answer, even though it was raised in a over-indulgent manner.

I played the guitar for several years but never got far enough to
compose something of my own.  So with a maesure of honesty I could say
that I program music because I failed to play the guitar.  However, I
understand that Nick can play real instruments very well but is still
compelled to write musical software, so there must be something in it.

So why do we feel the need to distance ourselves from the experience of
plucking each individual sound out of a musical instrument?

The answer for me is that I find it more satisfying to work in this
way.  Any distance from the sound is an illusion.  We may be a level of
abstraction away from the sound but that doesn't necessarily distance us
from it.  We still have full control over the timbre, but we are working
on the composition at the same time.  In fact we are able to think of
timbre and composition as different resolutions of the same thing, which
of course they are.

From: alex <alex
Date: Wed, 07 Jul 2004 22:33:38 +0100



I've found live programming during a performance a problem.  In recent
experiments I've been  preparing some scripts in advance, running them
and then finding myself tweaking variables rather than working the code
in any significant way.

So while I have found live coding to be an inspiring and productive way
of writing music at home and in my studio, the way I'm performing with
these pre-prepared scripts seems a step back from how I was working
before.  I've thrown away the user interfaces to reveal the code below,
but am then just editing numbers that are scattered around the screen.

So what I'm aiming for now is to be able to start with a blank text
editor and write code from scratch during the performance.  Has anyone
tried this approach yet?  I seem to remember you saying something about
pd wars Tom, where the artists compete against each other, starting with
an empty patch and seeing how quickly they can make something good.

I think it could work well.  Many times I've spent hours on a problem,
come up with an ugly solution, then re-written a better version later in
a fraction of the time.  There are some things, such as chat systems or
website backends that I've made many times over with the same ideas, and
yet they've ended up behaving quite differently for whatever reasons,
each creation satisfying in its own right.

I suppose it lends a certain structure to the performance, starting off
with one very simple element, developing it a little, adding a little
bit of structure until it becomes something like a melody, then starting
up another editor, introducing another simple element, developing that
into a simple rhythm, then coding in some interactions between the two
processes perhaps, and going from there. 

Just because code exists on disk after a performance, it doesn't
necessarily mean that it should be run again...  It could be thought of
as a kind of fossilised improvisation.  Not even a record of a
performance, but a frozen impression of the performance at the moment of
its death.

So I'm collaborating on a set with a drummer at a headphone festival in
london next week (http://state51.org/placard/).  Even though the set
will only be twenty minutes it seems that I'm going to have to try this
out.

I'd better sleep now anyway, apologies for my late-night ramblings!  No
conclusions here, just stray thoughts...

Perry and I did this in both our Princeton performance and NIME 
performance
in Japan (will post report).

In the Princeton performance (our first on-the-fly performance), we 
started
with blank editors (I in full-screen ms visual studio and perry in 
pico) and
would type out complete (but short, 2-10 line) ChucK programs which we
then saved to disk and ran concurrently from the command line in cygwin
shell (perry and I each had a single virtual machine to run all 
program/shreds).
The audience saw the whole process.  We had no backups, which caused
the audience to watch us type in silence for 2 minutes because my first
program just wouldn't work (probable cause due to parser bug I later
found).  The video that was shown was taken from this performance.

At NIME, we were on os x - both in TextEditor with pt 50+ font.  We 
started
with blank programs, but this time we also had simple programs from 
which
we started from (such as drum loops written in ChucK) and edited both as
parameters and structure.  Pictures of my desktop, our score can be 
found
here:

     http://soundlab.cs.princeton.edu/listen/on-the-fly/nime2004.html

An important reflection from both shows was that it actually REALLY 
helps
to have typed in and thought about some of the code during practice, 
more
so in the way of a traditional instrument than a piece of software.  
This is
true especially if you are starting in tabula rasa mode.  The audience 
can
see how fluid you negotiate the code - and they can get a sense of your
thought process through your pauses and "punctuations".  It totally 
give both
the performer and audience some strange notion and measure of 
virtuosity.

We did nearly exactly what you described.  Our NIME performance was
more advanced than our first - the language was more complete, we had
more unit generators.  We also really learned a lot from our first 
attempt,
so we felt more mentally stable (ha) this time.  ChucK programs can
start/replace/stop other ChucK programs with sample-precision, so higher
level programs were written to manage lower-level programs with precise
timing.  Perry's drum loops morph'ed over time as he changed code and
swapped in new programs.  The processes interacted with each other
using timing directives.

We are working on ways to playback a ChucK performance with precision.
But, Alex's idea of the frozen impression is much more poetic...

Hi ..

heres my two pence..

I use PD for most of my coding audio, but I have also written quite a few
apps using, c++
and libs like portaudio and the vst interface sdks..

Basically there is a limit to how 'basic' your starting set can be, but all
systems will actually be quite similar
in terms of libraries available.. PD has a built in set of about 50
objects/commands, such as osc~
which is a sine generator (as is cycle~ in Max). Now this object is not that
much different from using a standard
math.h sine() command in C, Ok you can mess about with using wavetable
lookups instead of algo generated sines,
but were talkning about the same sort of function. In fact a langage like
c++ or PERL contain
much more inbuilt object/functions than an audio language/environment like
PD. Unless you want to start working in ASM,
(In which case you will probably take quite a while to get a sound out) then
most langs hold the same linguistic/syntactical
functions.

The key to the work I think is to do with the environment. PD/MAX/SC/ etc
are designed to allow realtime experimentation with code
The compilation process is constant and the interface is the most
significant aspect. Granted I could code everything inside Visual studio and
run parallel compilations using raw c code and portaudio lib, but what is
the point, I could spend the whole gig building the motherboard, or
mining the copper for my silicon bath;) Of course we all know this, but
sometimes we can get a bit too puritan.
If i was live coding from scratch I would work with what pre-existed in the
app and then the sticky point comes when I decide
what other objects/function to include in my initial pallette (whether
written by me or by others).

One thing I find hard not to include is reverb patches... I can write delays
on the fly and therefore all kinds of modulation stuff etc,
but a decentish reverb is half an hour of  wiring up allpass n delays etc.
do you let the aestheic of the basic form disallow such processes,
or do you include certain pre-coded elements...Of course if you wrote the
initial system (such as some of alex's perl stuff i guess)
then who can say what is part of your base set?

PD is a very visual language and as such it is great at revealing the
thought processes and construction methods to people who cant follow
a three level pointer structure in text. Its also very easy to break/re-make
connections and play with flow, which is a great aid to
improvisation and experimentation. And of course all the patches are simply
text files which I guess you could write in an editor ;)
(I prefer PD to max because it is closer to the pure level of audio coding,
but I'm sure others would already think that
it is too 'dressed up' itself). I mean we could just pipe our kernels to
dev/dsp and be done with it, now thats live code ;)

Anyway, just my RAM on the loose again.

hmmm, actually, what i was trying to do with the photography example was 
not compare rejection, but compare mechanical forms of artmaking. the 
reasons it was difficult for people to accept photography at first were  
largely that it was mechanical (in both apparatus and in the fact that 
it "reproduced reality", unlikely painting)  and because people  
largely didn't differentiate between the art 
and craft of painting - "hey photography is just pushing a button; anyone 
can do that!"  now people accept photographic art because they've 
come to understand that the "art" of photography is different than that of 
painting - as well as the idea that art and craft are two different 
things.

as to your question alex about, "why do we use computers" - i can - or
could - play several instruments and got far enough with some to be a
performance major in college - but i was always frustrated because my
craft was ok but not excellent, despite lots of practice - my mind knew
what it was trying to express, but my fingers didn't move quickly or
deftly enough to express it. (i'm also lousy at most sports). so i was
held back from this type of "artmaking" because of physical limitations.
using computers, one can push past these. (speaking of art and craft, it's
ironic that many conceptual artists reject computer art, when the "art
over craft" argument was one they were famous for.)

this all might sound strange given that vj ubergeek performances are
intentionally very physical and play with the physicality of geekish 
activities like typing...  but knowing what a clutz and a goofup i am,
i've designed the software so that i just have to be physical, not
terribly adroit :-)...

No, the output can be better than is availible in commercial software -
the key word is "live". Livecoded music in a pure sense would be live
music in the way that a fruity loops setup would not be. I may be well
out of line in saying this, but a lot of electronic music seems to read
"live" as "I'll mix prewritten/recorded sections and tweak some
effects". Live code should develop (no pun intended ;) ) as the
audience/performer hears it (for the first time). 

I think its a return to good old fashioned bashing and stumming of
(real) objects a la jazz/improv music. Livecoding should allow just that
bit more flexibility to do this with software.

I'm interested in this approach too - genetic programming could be seen
as a very rapid way to livecode, the abilitity to get in there and
modify code manually which is then present in the genome, or mutate code
once you had handwritten it live - interchangably - would be very

I'm playing with a very simple form of this for my placard performance,

Hi All,

just another pin to throw in the stack/

I recently did a show in Mexico city where I had 6 PCs, my laptop and a
gameboy running nanoloop.
I had all the outputs running throgh a mixing desk and I had a channel
switcher for the vdu projector.
Each machine was running a different peice of audio(visual) software I had
written.
(Bitmapseq,Avseq, PD patches etc etc)
http://www.nullpointer.co.uk/-/images/mexico1.jpg
I moved from machine to machine,  opening/closing and interacting with
applications,
while also keeping track visually with the switcher and mixing on the desk.
The performance was about 45mins during which I improvised with the software
and
followed various emerging themes etc. I guess it wasnt livecode as such
(even though certain elements were)
but more like an equivalent of vinyl mixing your own dubplates... needless
to say it was great fun to
play (and I'm told to watch) and was quite exhausting running between and
balancing all the different elements.

The next day I ran a PD workshop with all the PCs networked to a master
ether clock, people were
writing simple instruments that were triggered by the shared tempo, it added
up to a nice/strange
consensual coding/jamming thing..

( hope i dont sound like i'm blowing my trumpet too much here ;) )


I'm quite intrigued by this aspect of multiple systems on multiple
machines..
I know alex runs a lot of perl apps concurrently and I've taken to multi
tasking audio apps on one machine,
I guess SC server sort of works in a similar way, but have people worked
much with this sort of distributed
composition/processing?

What software(s) were you using for your performance?  It sounds 
intriguing.
Do you program notes or recording?

ChucK is designed to be concurrent.  You can add and modify each
process (shred in ChucK) during runtime, and because writing timing
is part of the program flow, all shreds are automatically synchronized
to each other by time - this means new shreds on be written on-the-fly,
and can easily discover and share the audio, precise to the sample.

I am sorry that I am trumpeting ChucK so much - it's that this type of
multitasking is what ChucK is built for.

It doesn't exist yet, but the audicle (another current, giant software
disaster zone of ours) is designed to be an environment to 
collaboratively
code audio.

There is a couple of projects that worked over the network. SC2 had 
an OSC layer that was used by quite a few people. For example Ron 
Kuivila did a workshop (ICMC Berlin 2000) with networked sound 
compostion (Rhizome Caf=E9, an extension of David Tudor's Rainforest). 
(There was actually a short breakout of live coding after I was fed 
up with gui)
Some other projects are mentioned here:

http://swiki.hfbk-hamburg.de:8888/MusicTechnology/194
http://swiki.hfbk-hamburg.de:8888/MusicTechnology/161

I had written a shared control space for sc2 we sometimes used in seminars.

Alberto de Campo and I have a workshop/performance series called 
Warteraum (like waiting space or waitingroom) which is about 
networked live coding. It uses two paradigms, one is algorithmic 
granular synthesis, the other is using a shared version of jitlib 
that allows to share continuous sound processes. SC3 is always a 
server client structure, so the scaling towards a multiclient 
multiserver architecture is fairly straightforward. I've written a 
broadcast server that helps to distribute messages to various users. 
We also use a chat to transmit code, which is a simple thing but has 
proved very effective. Out of this seminars also comes a performance 
group, 'powerbooks unplugged'.

This Saturday I'm performing with a friend who's also called Alex, he's
going to play drums, processed by a weirdo max/msp patch he wrote and
which I don't understand fully.  We are syncing (he's going to build up
loops) and communicating via OSC, for example I can send him a message
/change, which makes lights blink on his screen telling him that I'm
getting bored.

But I don't think we'll use that.  I like to think of us as people
performing and playing using our different instruments, communicating
with each other through the sound rather than ethernet.

I once took part in a workshop that was based around people writing
software together, networking together their various coding environments
and then making a system based around idea of cocktail recipes.  In the
end it didn't go very well, we spent the whole time working on the
technical aspects of networking max to perl to flash etc etc, and no
time doing anything particularly creative.  In the end we mostly gave up
and concentrated on the making and drinking of real cocktails.

So beyond time synch I can't think if I've seen a good use of networking
in this kind of performance.  Some success stories of this type of thing
would be good to hear though...

By the way, I'm having a lot of success with my decision to remove the
save function from my editor.  Last night we did four run-throughs and
each one was completely different.  It's great working without having
any structures pre-defined, starting from ideas in my head.

However, at the end of every run-through I'm left with some processes
running which I might really like, and then have to kill them knowing
that I'll never be able to recreate them quite the same again.

Ah, yes that is a good point.  Sorry, I'm so used to photography being

to that aspect of the comparison.

I was lousy at sports at school too, at least I was always picked last
for football/rugby, although in his essays Paul Graham tells us that
this is because we didn't have the time for popularity contents that are
part of all school activities.

I took beginners courses in the guitar and the trumpet but although I
never got to be good, I don't think it was just the craft aspects that
let me down, but I just got frustrated with not being able to make
anything new.  I'd play someone elses tune or copy someone elses rhythm
but I just couldn't find a way of making my own tune or rhythm.

I think programming has helped me really forget about the mechanics of
reciting and forced me to try to create something new.  I don't think
I'm particularly successful but it has got me further than the guitar
did at least.

Handy, although I suppose one problem is that it can't save what you

It says on your website that you're synthaesthetic.  You're probably

I commit to playing from scratch too like Alex and practising like a

danger of too blank a slate, improvisations are usually rooted in a style.
I can't wait for free jazz programming devotees though...).

There are haptics in programming- I can enjoy typing. But feel of typing
doesn't lead to musical themes in the same way themes fit keys or the

conscious control that you get a rush of pleasure in the flow of your own

The two Alex'es performance of drum & perl was a highlight of the day,
slowly building up beats and the odd blast of acid melody as
drummer-Alex freeformed on top. 
Lots of terminal window action - bit difficult to see the code itself

I find the keyboard/mouse combination pretty useless for expression
personally, although I am stuck with it. I also think they make it
difficult to express process to an audience. I'm really interested in
moving code away from text (or boxes and wires) and into more immediate
forms. 

I have some embryonic ideas of a system where you would set up chain
reactions with big primary coloured lego blocks (a bit like a build your

Sorry about that - the problem wasn't with the mixer in the end but with
my dodgy soldering further along the chain...  With all the problems
that had caused the projection completely escaped my mind.

I was really pleased with my live coding, it was much more fun
programming from scratch than using the "one i'd made earlier"
approach.  The results were quite simplistic, mainly building rhythms
out of modulos and sinewaves...  But as a first (and second)
from-scratch live programming performance, it did feel like a whole new
world opening up.

It was a lot of fun performing with french Alex, we'd been practising
together for a while until I made the sudden decision to stop using
pre-prepared code.  The following (and final) practice session was far
better than the previous ones.  I was able to react to what he was doing
in a far more satisfying way than before.  We did four run-throughs in
that session, each one being really quite different.

French Alex is actually more of a pro bass player I believe, it was the
first time he'd played drums in front of a live audience.  He was
sampling and processing his drum hits with max/msp, and as a side effect
we stayed in perfect sync (when we wanted to).

Sorry for my part in this - had had a lot of problems with missing
channels in the first few performances which we traced to my dodgy
soldering which had deteriorated since last year!

> A mate of mine recorded the gig, am I allowed to upload it Alex?

Of course - they're your recording rights!  To be honest I took a
recording too, I have the entire festival (apart from some bits lost
through a couple of power outages) as uncompressed wavs.

Sadly I was running about too much to listen to your set properly,
although I listened to it today.  Ace!  A few of the others at state51
paused from their work to listen, raise their eyebrows and mumble
approval too.  

I listened to your set too Tom, it rocked out, and I enjoyed that
infinite loop you mentioned...

There's still a couple of weeks left of the placard festival, maybe we
should make a live coding placard session before its over?  Linked via
the Internet, with toplap-ratified video streams of our desktops.  More

The runme/dorkbot citycamp is 25/26/27 august in Aarhus, Denmark.  It'll
be a nice three days of workshops, presentations and performances.  The
two days before, the 23rd and 24th, will see the readme software art
conference, more of an academic conference with presentation of papers
including the TOPLAP one.  They are like two parts of the same thing
with a lot of crosstalk, but I guess a lot (most?) people will not
attend both.  The free accommodation is officially full up but there may
be a chance to fit you in - let me know asap if you want me to ask on
your behalf.  Likewise I think that the travel funds are used up but
there's no harm asking.

On the other hand I think text has some advantages that other forms
might not.  Text can be startlingly evocative, and have a rhythm and
structure that relates well with music.  It can be as precise or vague
as you like, and the different extremes may be traversed with the
introduction or omission of a single word.

But yes, as far as writing text and in particular code is concerned, it
is rather slow.  I'm a really slow writer.  The Perl language is a lot
faster than many computer languages to use, but even so, typing an
algorithm to make a rhythm can be a lot slower than hitting it out a
drum.  However by writing that text you're invoking actions that are
much faster than a drummer.

One way of looking at it is that writing code is an extremely fast form
of expression, it just has a lot of latency!

I read somewhere recently (probably wikipedia) that turing complete
computers are impossible to build because they require infinite memory. 
In any case, turing completeness seems an arbitrary constraint.  

I think our earlier discussions led us to realise that it is probably
not possible to strictly define the scope of toplap code.  So we have to
content ourselves with defining live coding as working closely with the
composition of the music, rather than being almost completely abstracted
away from it by consumer software.

There were a lot of ableton live performances at the london placard. 
Because the performances were back to back and only 20 minutes long, we
had four stages, so up to three acts can be setting up while the fourth
person plays.  At one point all four stages had laptops running ableton
live!

well, not entirely serious. But I finally got to see a copy of Delaney's

Not even Max/MSP gets a proper mention, and as for PD, SC, custom software, 
live coding, alternative controllers beyond the obvious MIDI slider stuff...

Dave, lego blocks sound fine for computing, tangible interfaces are a very

Subject: [livecode] coding from scratch




Yeah, I had fun at placard (shame I couldnt stay longer),
I didnt start from scratch though (boo, hiss etc),
But decided instead to do some on the fly recoding of some semi-complete
patches.
It got a bit hectic at one point, when I was running about 3 instances of PD
and managed
to code in an infinite loop... oooops, things got a bit locked up and a nice
screaming feedback
made some peoples ears hurt, I kind of lost direction after that..

Saw alex's set too, and a few other really interesting things...
made me think of a couplke of things though..

1. Would a group livecode set be more rewarding than a solo one..
Alex and alex worked well together, because I think that the speed of
development was
quite well matched. Your familiarity with your environment (software) and
the ease of that
environments use obviously effects the speed of performance development.
With multiple
performers working together these development instances would be staggered
and possibly
lead to a more organic and freeform development (often devlopment stages are
tied down to the
final line return or execution command,particularyl in command line based
systems)

2. Alex was calling routines with argument sets to create various arpeggios,
rhythmic structures and so on.
this was interesting to see (I agree about the projector though) but still
remains quite a closed
box to most viewers (unlike alexs flower app). Its hard to see the source
material and relate sonic changes to
visual changes in this material.. I suppose one advantage of ableton etc is
that you can see the samples and their
postions etc.. I'm not sure exactly what I'm trying to say but I would have
been intrigued to see some wavetables
or sample data somewhere, or some other forms of representation/interaction.
This is of course a personal taste thing though..

3. text interface. although above i was being keen on different form of gui
and representation i think that text can be a very powerful
method of interacion and display. Theres something that seems more permanent
in a text phrase than an icon.
and text interfaces can also represent the history of a performance in a way
icon/gui based work cant..
revisions are easier to see and theres a closer allusion to poetry and the
elegance/efficiency implied

mmmmmm anyway, lots to think about as usual, well done all the placard team!

yeah, I change my opinion a lot on this subject - I like the idea of
trying to look at programming in different ways, but when it comes down
to it I won't let go of my text editor... (endured a spate of UML
flirtation from managment a few years ago at work, and got all precious
about text)

I think at the very least we need to come up with some good languages
for live programming - maybe even design one for the purpose.

it's the idea that if you can use a machine to duplicate the properties
of a turing machine (which is a universal computer) even given infinite
memory and time - it can be used to create any other machine - which is
nice, and important somehow. 

Cellular automata can be made into turing machines (glider guns can be
made into logic gates etc...) Most programming languages obviously, but
not languages like HTML, and probably not my melodic lsystems.

I'm happy with this definition, as it's closer to the point than going
off down the computer science route. I think there is a continuum of
interface between the knobs and sliders of ableton live and the code we
are using - the fact we seem to need to do this highlights a shortcoming
of accepted ideas in GUI land maybe.

more waffle,

well, it probably does cover 90% of live laptoppery these days - and you

I liked the development of your set, you had a good pace (I got a bit

Should have grabbed you for a chat, but it was all quite busy by then
(and competition for sockets was fierce ;))

I think there is some ground between text and gui that isn't often
covered, flow graphs are close, but I think there may be more ways of
doing it. I'd like a complete programming language that is visual
(shapes, colours, no text) and clear enough for an audience to see a
clear correlation between what they are seeing in the "code" and what is
happening. I'm probably asking for too much...

I agree.  ChucK currently allows code to be added/changed on the fly,
you can do this from the command line, or from within the ChucK program,
which can write new programs on-the-fly.  Perry and I are working on
making this happen at an even finer level (per line/per instruction).
ChucK is also totally open to new ideas - especially from people like
all of us live coders.

Also, I am totally down with designing other languages.  Perhaps an
updated version of Forth - the ultimate write-only language!  That is
really what we want (sometimes).  write-only.  If others are interested,
let's look into this more!

Environments are also crucial.  we have an audicle site:

Hi,

I've just been lookinjg at the docs for chuck, seems like a good idea.
Seems a bit like sc server?
I'm interested in the system but I'm also intereseted in the einvironment,
As I've mentioned earlier, I beleive that the environment has as much to do
with the
performance as the parsing/execution system..
In chuck I can see it would be beneficial to have the ability to run
multiple windows
holding code fragments that can be cut/paste and 'shredded' etc. allowing a
multitasking fluidity to the
environment. It would be nice to allow users to define chuck files as 3rd
party generators etc
(as in max/pd as both compiled code and as language built subroutines), and
have these to
be easily accessible in the performance environment.
(you may already have this functionality as I didnt dig really deep into the
code stuff)
This may well be a case of adding extra shells to the
system but it could radically effect the usability/performance flow etc
mmmmmmmmm i think i've just realised that you have a project 'audicle' that

At a high level, some stuff (like the listener/client setup) is like SC 
Server.
the language and programming model is quite different, with the timing
model and the precise support for concurrency (both really work 
together)
ChucK, in some sense, is more like a poor-man's Max, where you can
connect ugen's quickly.  Where it differs from Max/SC and many other
languages is that the control for the ugen's can be completely separated
from the patching itself, and can be exerted at arbitrary time 
granularities.
The concurrency is very useful here to organize everything according
to the needs of the program.

> I'm interested in the system but I'm also intereseted in the

We totally agree on this.  both the language(s) and environment(s) are
crucial pieces to effective live coding.

Definitely.  The audicle will strive to do this, but the exact semantics
is still in the air.  Currently, the audicle is designed to have a flow
graph of windows denoting parent child shred relationships and
timing.  But this is still not well-defined.  Hopefully we can all work
on making this aspect fluid, like playing a good video game or even
better, a musical instrument.  Good thoughts Tom, let's keep going
on this.  And what do others think about this?

Yeah!  I think because ChucK has a well-defined set of
byte-code instructions and sample-synchronous timing, we can
do a compiled "plug-in" (an internal, ha) natively in ChucK.  This
feature doesn't exist yet.  Currently, it IS possible to import
ugen's and generic libraries from c++ (not documented yet).

An interesting question with this is how to organize the predefined
stuff both as the performer and also make them available for the 
audience,
to perhaps hint and preview the audience for a taste of things to come.
I think we all may be experienced difficulty convey some ideas/algorithm
even the screen is projected.  This is really an interesting HCI-esque
research problem - how to effectively convey the process visually to the
audience?

I am very glad you did.  In addition to new ideas, it shows that we
have been thinking in similar directions for the things to
try/research next!  ChucK is very young (currently implementing
arrays, ha), and it really isn't based on any one language.
we are free to move it in new and better directions (certainly from
its current rather fledgling state).  Come and join the
discussion list - currently 70+ souls are subscribed.

Sure why not?

The deadline for submissions to the transmediale award is coming up,

That'd be good - I'd like to host it here but it can be quite cold in
the factory then.  Otherwise we could do something at the ICA perhaps.

Hi,

Tom Holley from Ultrasound is asking for a TOPLAP proposal.   

  http://www.ultrasound.ws/

Who would like to go?  It'll be towards the end of November and is in
Huddersfield.  He doesn't know how much funding the arts council will
give this year, but overseas travel might well be possible.

Ade and I went before, it was well organised and well funded (although
we forgot to claim our fee).

Hi Guys,,

I live round the corner (well in the countryside nearby) and will have a
rand% installation on there at the same time.
I've played twice there before at ultrasnd and i reckon its pretty good.
Quite relaxed and a good mix of stuff. Me and Joe (other 50% of rand()% and
from powerbooks4peace,plank,vend etc) will probably be around a bit too, but
I dont think I'll be performing or doing too much this year as my 1st child
is due
right around then!!! Oh and Nick, we're getting a mac online as part of the
rand()%
support so hopefully we'll be able to run some SC stuff.. so if you know of
anything/anyone....?

Martin and jonny from ap played last year and were awesome...
I think they are doing something at dorkbot?
They might be interested in the toplap project too..
hmmmm....

Hey alex,

I may have a suggestion to give as an external listener to your interesting
discussion.

It may actually be good to state shortly and firstly what are the different
possibilities a musician has to compose/play music with a computer. Many
people are still very confused about it (even musicians themselves). At
least the difference between "live composition" and the use of tools to play
existing (prerecorded ?) material. People may have already a little idea
about it (or not at all) but they would more easily understand your point
after that.

> Some computer languages allow changing a running process on the fly by
> rewriting the code that defines it. Applied to computer music this means
> that one can write sound compositions while they are already playing.

The relationship between computer languages and "computer music" is for you
natural and when your are talking about it, I hear a guitarist or a piano
player talking about its instrument. But the link is far from being obvious
to people generally and moreover for traditional musicians who are still
very much going towards computers for their abilities to sequence and edit
music and not so much for composing.

For this you may have to go through a rough explanation of the entity of
electronic music or how a computer "understand" music. A good introduction
to this has been written by Miller Puckette, as an online book:
http://crca.ucsd.edu/~msp/techniques.htm

Sure, for a short proposal, it may difficult to condense this in one or two
phrases but I think they are quite essential.

WOOOW this is very interesting guys, I keep on listening....
Alex (the French one).

I've added/amended below- one important one, changed Algorithmic 
Programming to Algorithm Programming- the human action is in writing 
algorithms on the fly. You could metarise this to Algorithmic production of 
programs, but Algorithm covers the meta-levels too whereas Algorithmic 
Programming is either a tautology or a specialism.
 
Some of this can be adapted expanded (and chuck in a few things from our 
papers...) for other proposals. N
 

Some computer languages allow a programmer to change a running process on 
the fly by rewriting the code that defines it. If the output of that code 
is a process being revealed to human senses, an interactive performance is 
possible. Applied to live computer music this means sound compositions can 
be heard as they form, and musical algorithms adjusted while already 
playing.
 
TOPLAP is the Temporary Organisation for the Promotion of Live Algorithm 
Programming, set up to explore the application of live programming to 
composition and performance. TOPLAP advocates treating algorithms as live 
artistic material, allowing them to be written and manipulated while they 
create music or video, perhaps in front of an audience.

The interests of the TOPLAP membership encompass live coding performances 
with output in both audio and visual modalities, the possibilities of 
immediate feedback given by prototyping compositions in interpreted 
programming languages and new languages for on-the-fly programming. This 
international organisation is gathering membership and profile. Recent 
performances and demonstrations have taken place in Japan, USA, Sweden, 
Germany, England and Denmark.

TOPLAP proposes an evening of performances from live coders, with both 
audio and visual outputs. The audience will see and hear the created 
musical and visual material, and also the projected screens of the 
participants so that the processes are entirely open and the craft 
apparent. The coded improvisations show a novel blend of intellectual and 
emotional content that challenges existing notions of both traditional 
haptic instrumental and DJ like laptop performance.

(this is where I'd list who'd play, but we''d need confirmations and prob. 
unecessary at this point- Alex, Nick, Dave using fluxus? dream list- 
Julian/Alberto, Ge...)

Date: Tue, 17 Aug 2004 14:47:51 +0100


Hi all,

I've been doing more work on the live music tools I used for placard, and I
thought I'd document the score system a bit more formally, as It's become
integral to the whole setup, and might be of interest to other people:

http://www.pawfal.org/index.php?page=ScoreCode

I've mentioned it here before, I'm still not sure if it counts as live coding,
but the way it's used is to have text entry fields for the axiom and rules of
an l system which produces the final (usually quite large) score strings that
the sequencer can play.

There is a screenshot of the old setup here:
http://www.pawfal.org/Software/noiseengine/images/live.png
The five windows along the middle of the screen are the melodic lsystem
generators, with the axiom entry at the top - all containing "!1" which simply
resets the frequency and instanciates rule 1. The four text entry fields in
the middle are the rules.

Looking forward to seeing some of you in Arhus, looks like it could be quite
popular, I'm having quite a bit of difficulty finding somewhere to stay - so
it could be the campsite for me :)

cheers,

dave

Subject: [livecode] dynamic typing in proxy space


--============_-1118753494==_============
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii" ; format="flowed"


I've been wondering for some time if the system of proxies in proxy 
space could be changed to a dynamically typed system. Currently there 
is audio rate, control rate, and the permutations with the number of 
channels. Attached is a system that removes this limitation. I don't 
know if it should be done though.

Anyway, here is some thoughts:

what would be the benefits of a entirelly dynamically typed proxy system?

	pro:
	- conceptual beauty
	- playing dynamism


	cons:
	- might cause unexpected cpu peaks when changing number of 
channels of a big network of proxies
		-> more responsibility
	- makes code a little more complex (uh.)
	- introduces some cases of ambiguity:
		-> using event streams, which do not have a rate 
information,			it is not guaranteed to be correct
		-> retrieving the index from outside, say for using 
synth messages, index needs to be
			updated


________

well if you like, try it, (you'll have to replace ProxySpace.sc by 
the attached new version) and tell me what you think.


best whishes,
Julian

I'd be happy to have a bash at smartening up the site visually. A CSS 
for the wiki would be a good start and the logo should be incorporated

Or is it in TOPLAP's interest to retain the 1996 HTML chic?

I'm definitely for this, you should have sudo access so feel free to

It's all embedded in the cgi script which is installed from a debian
package so will get upgraded with the rest of the system, so can't
really be edited as it is.  You can specify a css file in the config

While promoting the placard presentation french Alex and I were forced
into appearing on Resonance FM by a force of great evil.  However it
turned out to be a lot of fun.  We ended up playing one of Dave's live
coded lsystem tracks.

Anyway they were interested in featuring TOPLAP in a future program.  I
don't think their listening base is particularly huge but it might be an
interesting challenge to try to get the idea of TOPLAP across without
any visual clues.

Would anyone be interested in that?

Further to the wiki thing, I'm thinking it might be better to move to
another wiki that doesn't have crummy HTML built into Perl sourcecode. 
I might have a go at writing one from scratch in fact, although won't be
trying to do any design.

There's an interesting idea.  What level would it operate on?  I suppose
that because there are several different systems it wouldn't be possible
to write a TOPLAP tutorial that says in detail how someone can work with
live code.  Indeed, it would probably be against the fine principles of
TOPLAP to be so prescriptive about how things are done.  However it
might work on a higher level, for example a tutorial for how to make
your own live coding environment...  Running through the issues that we
have highlighted, for example, how a load / save function should work,
how much should be predefined, the role of graphical maps and
programming, and so on.  So really a tutorial that asks questions rather
than providing easy answers.

these are just quick semi-random grabs and i hope to get the whole  
thing online so we all together can agree on good selections for promo  
material.  also i'm keeping the dv original if this compression doesn't  
work out or if someone wants high-quality media.

line-up left-to-right:
dave - fluxus - visuals
alex - feedback.pl - sound (beginning&end)
nick - supercollider - sound (beginning&end)
fredrik - supercollider/jitlib - sound (second half)
tom - pd - sound (not end)
joe gilmore - max - sound
amy - the thingee - visuals

slightly annoyed that i can't finish this and concentrate on other  
work.  anyway, thanks all for a very good week.  great to meet up in  
person as always.

Ok, I'm up for it too so that's at least three - lets do it.  

The session would be with Tobi and Anna from dosensos:

It's from 21:30 to 22:30 on fortnightly Wednesdays - would you be able
to make that Nick?  You're welcome to crash round ours, alternatively we
could do a pre-recording with them but would that be cheating?

I'll fit into whatever Weds. only have dull boring conventional jazz funk

Hi all,

Just boring technical questions, how do you propose keeping timing
locked between performers, is this a job for OSC, or ye olde midi, or
something else (a big drum?) :)

Also a question for Alex - how do you specify timings using feedback.pl
and OSC? are timestamps in seconds or ticks? 

I'm just rewriting my sequencing app and I just need some pointers
really...

just got osc up and running (via Steve Harris's liblo), it seems pretty
nice. I see that you can timestamp event bundles to happen at a
particular time.

this is a slightly different matter to syncing multiple livecoding
sessions on different machines though. as far as I can see it (and I
might be being thick here, not sure what apps like sc and pd do) we'd
need a master clock - either specifying times for the next tick - or
broadcasting occasional sync times every x ticks to keep everyone in
time. and this is assuming we're all using the same real time clock...
confused...

Demystification is the aim, but I don't think it's realistic at this
point for people to understand the languages we are using (I don't
understand any of the sc code). I think simply showing it is enough for
people to see that things are happening and doing so live. It's a start.

People I spoke to said there was a tangable feeling of improvisation
and/or panic :)

Yep, one screen leads to total chaos (kudos to Amy for dealing with the
mixing though) - in the ideal setting we'd have a more controlled view
of the coding. Getting everyone to use a black background is essential
if the screens are overlayed - the pd window blew everything else away
:) 

Maybe a split screen aproach would be better - with current eq levels of
that performer, so you could see who was contributing what at a given
time. Whatever, we need something pretty complex in the video mixing
department with lots of people playing.

big spotlights on the current performers? :)

> p.s. i reckon maybe we should comment our livecode as we go along! ;)

A few observations from my POV, firstly a confession, I did load some
scripts up - really as new starting points to continue from. I think
I'll write some livecode template scripts for different types of
visuals. This might be a bit different from doing sound, not sure.
I reloaded the starting script a couple of times to take things in a
different direction. 

I had a great time too though - much more fun than I had imagined (even
with gl lockups), I am a total beginner at this performance malarky
compared to you guys though :) 

cheers,

dave

osc has quite a good system for timing I think.
It uses the NTP time server, to create time stamps according to the
osc time format (64 bit, first 32bit is seconds since 1970, second 32 
is divisions of a second).
You then simply schedule the packets ahead in time, so the maximum 
lag time is accounted for. This way you get very exact timing.

Yep but OSC doesn't really have a system for timing beyond being able to
specify that timestamp.  I mean, OSC doesn't directly interact with NTP
beyond borrowing its timestamp format, does it?

http://www.cnmat.berkeley.edu/OpenSoundControl/OSC-spec.html

NTP is great for synchronising clocks before and during a live jam, but
the various systems also need to start at the same time and go at the
same speed.  If one joins in while others are running then it needs to
be able to work out when to start, and when the speed is to change all
the systems need to know about it.

It would be great to work out a TOPLAP standard for time synch, a simple
one that is easy to implement.  Does anyone feel like working something
out together?  I don't mind taking my system apart and describing it in
detail if it would help, but bear in mind that while it works in
practice without drifting, it is fairly naive.

The time server is here:
http://cpan.org/authors/id/Y/YA/YAXU/perl-music-article/examples/tm-0.1.pl

and the client side stuff is here, in the spread_event_loop() routine:
http://cpan.org/authors/id/Y/YA/YAXU/perl-music-article/examples/feedback-0.1.pl

I'm using the 'spread' protocol and libraries to send timing information
around out of programmer's laziness, it would be better to use OSC for
this.  When it comes to sending messages to SuperCollider, I'm using
timestamped OSC bundles, with a little bit of buffering as Julian
describes.

Or does an OSC based timing protocol already exist without me knowing
about it?  How does SuperCollider deal with this?  Klippav, how do you
keep SuperCollider and Max in synch?

Hi All,

Was nice to see you all in Aarhus and run with the livecoding massive..

However I was wondering if we should try some sort of informal postmortem on
the gig.
I'm saying this because although I enjoyed it immensly It wasnt much like
what I expected
and I felt didnt really follow some of the ideals set out in the dox etc.

I'll outline a couple of my thoughts here, but feel free to flame me on them
if you like..

I felt that one aspect of live coding should be to de-mystify the process
and
reveal the act of coding to the audience so that they can gain a better
understanding
of the processes involved and have acloser relationship with the realtime
development of the
preformance.. I felt that in aarhus the 1 screen didnt really allow for this
as it didnt allow the audience to
follow a single visual source to understand the coding process and relate it
to the audio evoilution etc.
Perhaps this was also linked to the lack of a 'timesharing/movement'
structure... If one performer was to
'take a solo' for say 10mins (while others dropped out or stripped down
their output) then the av relationship could
bea more easily experienced..  I also felt that the constant mixing of
sources made this difficult to do.
In connection with this i was a bit confused by daves imagery, i wasnt quite
sure how it related to the
evolving performance (were you taking a feed from someone?) and i was keen
to see some of the code that
was actually generating the visuals...  I guess that it being a club
environment it was inevitable that
the performance would be geared in that direction, but i wonder how a less
'party' setting would effect the
experience/peformance...perhaps people maight be put more 'on the spot'
which could be interesting...

However not to be too picky I thought one aspect that worked amazingly well
was the fact that even with 5 people jamming
it didnt just trn into a noise out... I think that each person using a
different software and coding approach helped this
(just like a band of 5 guitars has less range when improvising than a band
with different instruments)
I think it was also the mix of personal improvisational styles that worked
also, a mix of ambient, drone, melodic, beat led etc..
I guess like all improvising the more we practice the better we will get
too....

anyway theres my 2 kroner... ;)


p.s. i reckon maybe we should comment our livecode as we go along! ;)   ///

Hmmm

Whenever i do this i've just used UDP messages and sent either beat counters
or just pulses..
I pretty sure that most other protocols use UDP/TCP (OSC for example)
Its quite easy in PD to write your own UDP parsing patches etc...but often
just picking up a groove counter works..
(and it seems to be pretty reliable too)
I sometimes run workshops and use a master clock that can be picked up by
all the clients via a local network UDP port..
But if you are talking about timing at buffer/chunk level then I'm not sure
it can be acheived very easily (especially if people are using different
samplerates etc)
(I guess you might be able to sync or something, but obvioulsy any network
speed will be slower than samplerate..)

I think the best moment visually was when Dave's livecoded visuals were
overlaid with/by simple code that was slowly being built up - abstract
visual forms flowing across the code, and pulsing with the music. 
Beautiful.  I think the switching between screens worked well during the
final showdown but didn't sit well with the slowly changing music.  This
is a personal point of view  - I'm not a very visual person and so can't
take in fast transitions.  Of course the answer is to have a projector
for everyone.

I don't think the code needs to be clearly seen though.  I think it's
just enough to see the code grow in complexity with the music, and the
overlaying works well for this.  Beyond that, nothing needs to be seen
or understood, although if someone really wants to read the code there's
no reason to stop them.  But I don't think there is any great necessity
to increase font sizes and position screens so that everything can be
clearly read by the audience.  For me the code should primarily be heard
and seen rather than read.

I also echo your thoughts Tom about it working surprisingly well
structurally and being a lot of fun!  It was all far too ace and must be
repeated.

yes, this is the funny thing - time stays relative and interwined 
with space, whatever we try..

On the osc list there was expressed the need for a synching method 
for OSC, so that on a request anyone can join in. I think that would 
be the best standard, because once you have synchronized clocks, the 
rest is easy.

we could agree on an osc message that contains a tempo information, 
maybe even, as a start, a simple clock tick without a timestamp, as 
LANs are quite fast anyway.

I had a lot of problems trying to get that to work with more than one
sound renderer.  I think each process needs its own timer.  Hmm, well
maybe I'll try to come up with a working prototype that uses OSC.

maybe that works in sc because the server thread runs at a very high priority.
But I haven't read the sources carefully yet.

It could give a jumpstart tutorial of several systems.  To give people
both an idea of how to get rolling, and that he/she can use more than
one system.  Basic features upon which to build live code experiments.
Learning (the systems, not a particular style necessarily) by example.

Here's my favourite comment from that thread, which perhaps highlights the 
danger of having just a little knowledge:

Real men use CSOUND for "programmed music" :)

Seriously, csound is designed as a programming language for music and is 
phenominally powerful and can be used in real time. If I were hacking code 
for music onstage, that is what I would use. Having said that, I'd rather 
use my guitar or synth(s) as they are the ultimate in "live composition" 
instruments...

this weekend at turning grade 4 into grade 8 and stretching the inbetweens. 
We can name some specific languages like ChucK etc to round it off, and 
invent a few classic pieces of the genre as set reworks- dave's recursive

I like this requirement particularly if it came in the final grade 8 exam:

Fantastic!  I wouldn't like to step in the beautiful prose in my current
state of mind, but some ideas:

1/ something about being able to encode a given algorithm without any
syntax errors or bugs, or perhaps to be fairer, no more than (say) three
goes at compiling and running it.

2/ the student being able to execute a given piece of psuedo code in
their head

3/ a later level could involve 2/, but with three levels of recursion

4/ on top of the 'getting 100 people to dance' point in grade 5, a much
later grade could require "getting 100 electro-accoustic musicians to
dance without the use of intoxicants"

5/ Show ability to dance convincingly to a given algorithm without it
being sonified

Yep, nice to drop some toplap ideas and watch the ripples!  At some
point I'll go through all the comments and find the ones that have are
actually good and insightful - there was at least one post that appeared
recently that suggested some more early prior-art.

I quite like the idea of the text standing alone, letting people just
imagine what it might sound like.  When we're ready for the big toplap
push I guess we'll have some sound and video recordings on the site... 
Those who will have their interest piqued will then be able to see and
hear the recordings within the fuller context of TOPLAP.

Subject: [livecode] various things from slashdot
From: alex <alex
Date: Sat, 04 Sep 2004 10:02:43 +0100


A couple of highlights...

There were a few intelligent comments by those who had read the article,
mostly correcting those who hadn't.  I won't bother reproducing them
here though.


A suggestion for grade number 9, perhaps:
"I think this is amongst the most pathetic, nerdy things I have read in
a long time. No wonder we have bad perceptions in the public eye. What
next I wonder? Masturbating in time to the squeals that a modem makes?"


I quite liked this comment:

> I've found the experiences of dancing and programming to have 
> a great deal in common.
Yeah me too, I don't always know what I'm doing but I have a great deal
of fun doing it.


A more generally interesting thing is that within two minutes of the
article appearing, someone had written a fairly long comment about the
Perl programming language.  It seems to me as though this was an
automated response by a bot.  A trollbot, perhaps grabbing comments from
other stories based on keywords.  It was very successful anyway, getting
a score of 5, set to "interesting," and a huge number of responses,
despite being very little to do with the subject of the article...  In
fact it seemed to be in response to a story about mobile phones.


But after reading through all the comments, there's only one that is
particularly interesting to us.  It's worth putting on the timeline,
shame it's an anonymous post.  I love the final sentence.

I wrote code on stage in xlisp and a midi control layer I wrote myself
back 'around 87. This was on an amiga 1000. I was actually wearing a
guitar when I called medium level functions to generate sound, which I
then played over.
(The project was called masked men and purveyed a mix of both
experimental and pop/dance oriented music)

I thought at the time I might have been the only person to have written
code/lisp code, but I posted about it on venerable online system "the
well" when I joined in 1990 and somebody said they'd written lisp on
stage in the 70s.
Maybe with a guitar strapped on. heh.

The music had to work around garbage collection, which I forced at the
end of phrases.

After the post of alex' live algorithmic music exploits on slashdot, it got
noticed by the mostly interesting, even if a bit misty weblog
lambda.the.ultimate [+], and there was mentionned a sort-of-funny language
called 'choon' [++]:

<< Choon is an esoteric programming language.

Its special features are:
. Output is in the form of music - a wav file in the reference interpreter
. There are no variables or alterable storage as such
. It is Turing complete

Choon's output is music - you can listen to it.  And Choon gets away without
having any conventional variable storage by being able to access any note that
has been played on its output. One feature of musical performance is that once
you have played a note then that's it, it's gone, you can't change it.  And
it's the same in Choon.  Every value is a musical note, and every time a value
is encountered in a Choon program it is played immediately on the output. >>

Dear Madam/Sir,

little old fashioned.
   We hope this is fine with you and will not disqualify us from 
participation.
With thanks for your upcoming judging efforts,
TOPLAP

three keywords: interactive performative instrument

URL: www.toplap.org

accompanied by proposal/explanation below, plus the site itself.

We agree to the conditions of entry and wish to enter the work for 
selection in the award as well as for club transmediale.



http://www.toplap.org/?TransmedialeSubmission

Some computer languages allow a programmer to change a running process on 
the fly by rewriting the code that defines it. If the output of that code 
is a process being revealed to human senses, an interactive performance is 
possible. Applied to live computer music this means sound compositions can 
be heard as they form, and musical algorithms adjusted while already 
playing.

TOPLAP is the Temporary Organisation for the Promotion of Live Algorithm 
Programming, set up to explore the application of live programming to 
composition and performance. TOPLAP advocates treating algorithms as live 
artistic material, allowing them to be written and manipulated while they 
create music or video, perhaps in front of an audience.

The interests of the TOPLAP membership encompass live coding performances 
with output in both audio and visual modalities, the possibilities of 
immediate feedback given by prototyping compositions in interpreted 
programming languages and new languages for on-the-fly programming. This 
international organisation is gathering membership and profile. Recent 
performances and demonstrations have taken place in Japan, USA, Sweden, 
Germany, England and Denmark.

Further information on TOPLAP artists, events and theory is available at:

http://www.toplap.org

The site contains links to archived performances, papers on live coding 
practise and history as identified by the group.

For the transmediale awards TOPLAP submits itself. In particular, we would 
like to highlight the LUBECK04 Manifesto for Live Coding Performance, as 
linked:

http://toplap.org/?ManifestoDraft

For instance, criticism of laptop performers is rampant (by an old guard?) 
but it is quite possible to fight such rejection on a better surface: 
projection of laptop screens to reveal the whole instrument. For audio 
especially, it is vital that we confront the issue of a level playing field 
between laptop musicians and conventional acoustic instrumentalists with 
such full disclosure. Even whilst the immediacy of gesture is still open to 
debate, the game is at least honest and education of audiences paramount. 
(Those who worry about trivialisation of such pedagogy are ignoring the 
possibility of closing your eyes whilst listening to music...). The 
information can be discrete, not overbearing: but definitely available.

The organisation has identified many avenues of exploration for text based 
interaction which we are seeking to address. Novel engagement with 
adaptable level control of as great a flexibility as code affords is a 
possibility too rich to ignore.

For club transmediale TOPLAP proposes a session of performances from live 
coders, with both audio and visual outputs. The audience will see and hear 
the created musical and visual material, and also the projected screens of 
the participants so that the processes are entirely open and the craft 
apparent. The coded improvisations show a novel blend of intellectual and 
emotional content that challenges existing notions of both traditional 
haptic instrumental and DJ like laptop performance.

Attendance of particular TOPLAP members would be negotiated, but the 
organisation is happy to also talk about its work in an appropriate forum.

Particular TOPLAP artists are linked from the site, which the judges are 
encouraged to explore to see the breadth of activity and enthusiasm in this 
new field.

Here's a netmage draft. They'd need to know who's available up front 
(roughly, I guess we can renegotiate later if accepted). I thought I might 
put in klipp av separately so left me + Fredrik off the list. Plus its 
unfair for me to try to be at every event... Are Perry/Alberto available? 
Julian, is the thought of being on stage horrendous and you'd prefer an off

Some computer languages allow a programmer to change a running process on 
the fly by rewriting the code that defines it. If the output of that code 
is a process being revealed to human senses, an interactive performance is 
possible. Applied to live computer music this means sound compositions can 
be heard as they form, and musical algorithms adjusted while already 
playing.

TOPLAP is the Temporary Organisation for the Promotion of Live Algorithm 
Programming, set up to explore the application of live programming to 
composition and performance. TOPLAP advocates treating algorithms as live 
artistic material, allowing them to be written and manipulated while they 
create music or video, perhaps in front of an audience.

The interests of the TOPLAP membership encompass live coding performances 
with output in both audio and visual modalities, the possibilities of 
immediate feedback given by prototyping compositions in interpreted 
programming languages and new languages for on-the-fly programming. This 
international organisation is gathering membership and profile. Recent 
performances and demonstrations have taken place in Japan, USA, Sweden, 
Germany, England and Denmark.

Further information on TOPLAP artists, events and theory is available at:

http://www.toplap.org

The site contains links to archived performances, papers on live coding 
practise and history as identified by the group.

For the Live Media Floor section of Netmage05 TOPLAP proposes a session of 
performances from live coders, with both audio and visual outputs. The 
audience will see and hear the created musical and visual material, and 
also the projected screens of the participants so that the processes are 
entirely open and the craft apparent. The coded improvisations show a novel 
blend of intellectual and emotional content that challenges existing 
notions of both traditional haptic instrumental and DJ like laptop 
performance. This is a true audiovisual blend, with the audio coders 
providing visual content from their programming interfaces, the visual 
artists running generative graphics tools with visible coding control.

There's a number of ways of doing it. Java has a number of interpreters for other languages available, so the changeable code could be written in (say) JavaScript. But that kinda breaks the model.

Writing bytecodes by hand is a no-go. :-)

So the best way would be to use Java's dynamic class loading and reflection functionality:
1. Have a text window with the running algorithm code in.
2. When the user changes the algorithm, get the text and wrap it in some boilerplate (a class with a single well-known method).
3. Compile it either by having linked the program to JavaC or by calling Runtime.exec("javac name-of-file-you-saved-the-text-in.java"), and check for errors.
4. Load the compiled class, get the method, and swap it for the one currently being called.

Sounds insane but it's doable. Modern Lisp systems compile code typed at the toplevel before running it, so this has some precedent (although the Lisp systems have the compiler built in and optimised for this).

I'm not suggesting you should actually do this, though. :-)

- Rob.

I've been mostly using Perl, live coding is not a huge problem as it's
an interpreted language.  I interpret code changes into a separate area,
and if that parses ok, I interpret it again, over the running code.  The
new code continues running with all variables intact.

But I'm wondering if you got the wrong impression from the Perl.com
article...  While it mentions both generative music and TOPLAP, TOPLAP
isn't an organisation to proliferate/promote autonomous generative
music.  Quite the opposite, we're here to promote live manipulation of
processes.

Generative music is about sowing seeds, comparable with genetic
modification; altering DNA, putting the DNA in eggs, and watching it
grow to see/hear the effects.  In contrast, TOPLAP is more about
splicing different live animals together, piecing them together from
scratch in the womb, modifying their DNA while they're still growing,
then experimenting with different ways of slaughtering them to get the
best audio/visual/aromatic effects.

Note the above is a metaphor, I would not condone any such activities on
real life-forms (computer processes are not known to experience pain,
and don't have faces).

The TOPLAP papers might be enlightening:
  http://toplap.org/?ToplapPapers

So while your fractal composition is interesting, I don't think TOPLAP
will ratify it until you can modify the algorithm while it is being
played.

Ade wrote something about what TOPLAP should expect from its students,
which you might find helpful: http://toplap.org/?LivecodingGrades

I think interpreted languages are the natural choice for live programming.
Despite all the jokes on the subject, compiling stuff live would not be fun! :)

Something I'd like to research is changing code on the machine level live.
There may even be precedents for this. I'm thinking of a system where you have
a virtual machine with a very simple instruction set (as in evolving machine
code systems like tierra). You'd be able to grab processes, and move the
program counter around and hack their instructions *while they are running* -
no write/interpret cycle at all.

For the ultra livecoding geek - it may be possible to get your head round a
real system without a virtual machine in simpler 8bit computers, or
microprocessors that allow code to be modified.

I do agree that dynamic languages are better for this, though.

Cool.

There's plenty of VMs around, varying from simulators for everything from the Apollo guidance computer (!) through PDP-8s to Z80s and PPC chips, to modrn runtimes like Parrot and the CLR. I hear Spectrum emulators are a favourite for washing machines, but I digress. :-)

A VM designed for live music hacking could have midi or sound ops, score operations, etc. as part of the instruction set. The registers, cache and memory could all be structures to support this. You could indeed hack that live at the machine code level, or have a higher-level language that interprets or compiles to it.

Prolog, Lisp, Java, Perl, Interactive Fiction and various other games all have their own VMs or even hardware machine implementations. Having a VM encapsulates the conceptual model of the language or the task, adding expressive power or aiding optimisation. This is a very important and popular technique.

Use a keyboard to generate bytecodes, playing the instructions live. A postmodern version of the old flip-switches and blinking lights seen on old computers (especially in films). :-)

Perry and I are doing this with ChucK.

     http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/

ChucK runs on a VM with special virtual instructions (many for dealing 
with time),
and is type-checked and compiled down to these instructions.  In this 
respect,
it is like Java.  However, it also supports truly precise audio timing 
and also
the ability to swap sub-processes (shreds) in and out of the VM.  It 
has complete
control over scheduling (shreduling) as well as the instructions.   We 
are working
on something now which can replace sections of virtual ChucK 
instructions at
runtime.  This is a VM designed for precise audio programming, 
on-the-fly.

Check it out and fire it up!

Best,
Ge!

Yeah, thats the sort of thing I had in mind. Most speccy emulators I've seen
are just huge switch statements with 256 cases, it would be cool to start with
something like that - or even more esoteric like a guidence system!

no high level languages - I'm actually thinking of a visual version of asm (so
each instruction has an icon that you can stack up) or something... so your
microcode statements form visuals which create the music. 
I haven't thought it through properly yet as you can probably tell.

This sort of thing starts to approach circuit bending in it's ethics, which I

If you're programming a high level language that is compiled into bytecode,
thats not what I'm talking about - that still seperates the actual running
processes from the coder (with a write/compile cycle). I'm thinking of a
system where you edit the machine code as it's running. In most sensible
situations this would only ever result in crashes :)

Hi All,,

Hey dave,

I'm writing a system based on this kind of idea..
basically it resembles a corewar style memory space with instructions of ASM
style
(but a little more verbose). Each mem line can hold 3 values which are read
as
a command with 2 variables.. it includes pointer based stuff and the ability
to write/copy from one memory location to another.. You can implement
corewar style 'battling' code fragments quite easily..
Its all written in C++ with an OPengl interface and a text editor for the
built in language. I'm still wrtiting in more command features and have to
finish the save/load functions but its working out very welll.. If you'd
like I can post a demo when its in a decent state (probably not till xmas)
I showed alex a bit of it briefly in aarhus, but really it needs a lot more
work done (especially drag/drop library routines etc)

I'm really into this sort of low level modular code writing and the
resulting sonification of such algos..
Its a sort of VM which has a sort of interpret phase but very fast..
(Basically you can edit lines and then commit them)
It only operates on a sample playback/manipulation basis at the moment, but
i'm thinking of putting some synthesis stuff into it..
But then I might just add an OSC/UDP library of commands and be able to use
SC or PD etc for the real DSP stuff.
Theres some great potential inthese sort of systems though, even if it can
get a little crazy with lots of nasty pointer stuff.!

While working on my system I did allow you to edit while executing, but you
are right,
it just lead to lots of crashes and other wierd effects..

for instance..

i am typing  10 Mov 20
but while i am typing it gets executed at
10 Mov 2
oops ! we get a valid execution but an unintentional process..

this started to get really silly with commands like

10 Mov 100
if executed at
10 Mov 10

and so on...

So now it only commits the line when you press return..
otherwise you find yourself racing to type before the execution point comes
around again!!
fun though!

The idea is that you can program ChucK virtual instructions directly.  
In
the "Turing Machine" sense, the virtual instructions are identical to 
native
machine code, but have the added benefit of being run in a controllable
environment (VM).  Check out:

     http://audicle.cs.princeton.edu/

In this sense, we can use any VM, however ChucK instructions are made
for sound synthesis.  There are low level operations (add,shift,or,mem 
etc)
as well as higher level instructions for scheduling.  There are probably
other systems that supports this directly.  But the benefits of the VM 
is that
it makes on-the-fly "assembly" programming feasible and maybe even
fun... =)  What do you think, Dave and others?

Best,
Ge!

I'd definately be interested in seeing this. So whats the OpenGL display - the
state of the registers and memory? Or do you have other instructions for
drawing to pixel data?
The thing I always found annoying with core wars, tierra and avida was that
it's really difficult to visualise whats going on. I guess it's difficult to
visualise a 1 dimensional memory space in a nice way.
I can imagine that you could get a lot out of the visualisation of the
internals of the VM though.

the nasty pointer stuff is where the potential is :)

ah, all the documentation I'd read looked like a high level scripting language
- I haven't seen the machine instructions.

so the question is - how much would it cost to convert these sorts of systems
into hardware? :)

We haven't documented them yet.  =)  But here they are:
All ChucK programs are type-checked and emitted into
byte-code consisting of the following, which are really no
different than native machine instructions.  At the end, there
is an example of a ChucK program and the corresponding
ChucK VM program.

The VM uses two stacks for each concurrent shred:  one for memory
and one as registers.  Also note the operations dealing with time.
One the reasons we implemented the VM with such an IS is so we
may later optimize and also replace sections of code at runtime.
Though the interface needs inventing, on-the-fly byte-coding is
very possible in the current VM.

no, but sort of yes - I've tried to write a description of this several times
and failed, so I'll resort to bad ascii art.

out to synth/sampler etc

the scale filtering allows you to exclude certain notes from the octave. It
should be apparent at this point that I know sod all about music theory, and
that filtering notes is a complete hack, but there you go :)

the cool thing is that I've dumped midi, so I can specify frequencies with
note events to my sampler and synth via osc.

on another note (and I'm aware this is getting a bit long and technical) I've
finally also got the sequencer and sampler apps to pass timestamped events
through osc in ntp format, and the sampler stacks them up to act on in time. 

so if/when we figure out a toplap standard syncronisation standard, I might be
able to use it somehow :)

perhaps I should just use ChucK or supercollider...

that seems quite ok. I guess you can use an array of floating point 
numbers as scale, so you are quite free. All the rest can actually 
happen a level higher,
so the filter should maybe be there.

Hello all!

I'm new at the mailinglist and just want to introduce myself a bit, hope
thats ok.

I'm living in Visby, Gotland (Swedens largest island), Sweden and for
the moment studying at Gotlands School of Music Composition. I've been
composing electronic music for around 9 years or so, and started to
compose instrumental music in the contemporary music field a year ago.=20
I've always worked in the experimental field of electronic music, and
the later years I have composed electronica and electro-acoustic music.=20

For the moment I work alot whith PureData and building my own
instruments. I'm also a freeform Trombonist that like to process the
Trombone sounds in realtime in a concert situation.=20

I've done a couple of concerts involving livecoding, but I've not yet
shown it to the audience with projectors which always has been my
intention, to show my workingplace and my 'instument' of the musicmaking
side, and give the audience a better understanding of the playing part
of the performance.=20

Subject: [livecode] live coding and genetic programming
Date: Tue, 21 Sep 2004 11:14:43 +0100


Hi all,

Just thought I'd come back to a topic I brought up ages ago, incorporating
genetic programming into live coding - I think they go well together - but of
course it totally depends on the application, it's really hard to evolve high
level general purpose languages, for instance.

So for my simple little melody language, I've rigged up a live coding
environment where you can flip freely between editing and evolving code.

Here are some screenshots:
The live coding editor, the code is on the left, the result is on the right:
http://www.pawfal.org/nebogeo/images/npeditor.png

And mutating the same pattern in the breeder, the original is the top left
pattern - left clicking on the pattern selects it and grows a new generation
of mutated copies:
http://www.pawfal.org/nebogeo/images/npbreeder.png

For a little more explanation, this is an extract from the half written
documentation:

---8<---

Lsystems are specified by the following convention:

axiom rule1 rule2 rule3 ...

Where the dividing characters can be any whitespace chars including newline. 
It's often clearer to write them in the following form:

axiom
rule1
rule2
rule3
...

Using lsystems to create music

Noisepattern encorages 2 forms of expression, live programming and live 
(human guided) genetic programming. you are free to flip between the the two
quickly and continously.

Examples:

First we write a simple scorecode lsystem that creates a nice melody: 

!1
2---2---2---2---2
o.+o.+o.2.2

Which after 2 generations expands to:

!o.+o.+o.o.+o.+o.2.2.o.+o.+o.2.2---o.
+o.+o.o.+o.+o.2.2.o.+o.+o.2.2---o.+o.
+o.o.+o.+o.2.2.o.+o.+o.2.2---o.+o.+o.
o.+o.+o.2.2.o.+o.+o.2.2---o.+o.+o.o.+
o.+o.2.2.o.+o.+o.2.2

Then we flip the code editor into it's breeder mode which gives us 4 identical
copies of this melody. They are identical as the mutation rate is set to 0 by 
default. Move this - to quite a low amount, try something like 0.1, then click
on one of the melodies.

There are now 3 mutated versions of this melody to audition, namely:

!o.+o-+4.o.+o-+4.2.\.\---o.+o-+4.o.+o
-+4.2.\.\---o.+o-+4.o.+o-+4.2.\.\!|-o
.+o-+4.o.+o-+4.2.\.\-.-o.+o-+4.o.+o-+

Subject: [livecode] an earlier manifesto
From: alex <alex
Date: Wed, 22 Sep 2004 15:42:31 +0100


I just found a manifesto that Ade and I wrote before giving a
performance at the ICA 4 years ago (almost exactly).  We were very keen
on the word 'generative' at that point, but we were talking about
writing software to make our music.

I like its unapologetic and clear style.  The text in brackets is
descriptive of the main manifesto point.

THE GENERATIVE MANIFESTO

1. Attention to detail - that only hand made generative music can allow
(you can go deeper into structures using code)

2. Realtime output and compositional control - we hate to wait
(it is inconceivable to expect nonrealtime systems to exhibit signs of
life)

3. construct and explore new sonic environments with echoes from our
own.
(art reflects human narrative, code reflects human activity)

4. open process, open minds - we have nothing to hide
(node is unambiguous, it can never hide behind obscurity.  we seek to
abolish obscurity in the arts)

5. only use software applications written by ourselves - software
dictates output, we dictate software
(authorship cannot be granted to those who have not authored!)

You have to imagine Ade *shouting* this at a room full of people while I
executed perl scripts we had written.  The screen was of course
projected.  I have the score as well but not an easily accessible
scanner.  Apparently a tape of the performance exists, somewhere.

Subject: [livecode] idea: musical interactive fiction



hey there--

	Yesterday I had a rather strange idea. I had been working on a novel
approach to "interactive fiction" (see http://netjam.org/cloak , which I
have working). I developed a rather useful parser for english. I started
thinking about other kinds of conversations I could have with it, and
realized that conversations about musical structure and performance
might be interesting. Now I think it would make a nice vehicle for
musical livecoding:

-	The exchanges are all in natural language, making them relatively easy
for an audience to follow, and perhaps even poetic.

-	The conversation can take place with high-contrast text on a black
background, making projection (and mixing with other projections)
straightforward.

-	Multiple people can interact in it at once, over the net (perhaps even
including audience members and/or remote parties).

-	It can fulfill various mundane show tasks (e.g., have a "room" which,
when entered, plays the pre-show background music).

	Here's a sample transcript, which I also have working:

***

	You are immersed in silence.

silence> create and enter a room called "livecoding"

	You're in the livecoding room.

the livecoding room> define an "oon" as a bassdrum pitch on the 10th
channel, at full volume

	Okay.

the livecoding room> define a "cha" as a hihat pitch on the 10th
channel, at full volume

	Okay.

the livecoding room> define an "ooncha" as an oon followed by a cha

	Okay.

the livecoding room> create an ooncha

	Okay, added an ooncha to the livecoding room.

the ooncha> set your duration to a quarter

	Okay, my duration is a quarter.

the ooncha> set your tempo to 120 bpm

	Okay, my tempo is 120 bpm.

the ooncha> play repeatedly

	Okay, I'm playing repeatedly.

the ooncha> stop

	Okay, I stopped.

***

	Thoughts? I'd also be delighted to receive suggestions in the form of
potential transcripts.

You could use autocompletion, and build up macros and patches 
beforehand. Make it persistent. A MUD/MUCK might be good. Populate it 
with scripts and jam in there, multiple live programming musicians. :-) 
Go from room to room to make different tunes, take the performance to 
each room as it's ready.

OT, this just gave me the most amazing idea. An IF interpreter in first 
or third person (rather than an imperative one) so that the complete 
transcript reads as normal fiction. So "I" or the character's name 
would be the prompt...

This is great. Amy's right - it does demystify programming in a live 
context.

There's something vaguely HyperTalkish about it, though. And whilst 
that's generally a positive thing for accessibility, there's something 
rather silly about statements like

   if there is a character "?" in theQuestion then
     put "!" into character (the length of theQuestion) - 1 of 
theQuestion
   end if

Natural language coding is great for beginners but it gets messy very 
quickly when - as a programmer - you need more advanced possibilities. 
More awkwardly, avoiding such verbosity is also dangerous. Look at the 
mess Lingo is in with it's half-baked dot syntax. The language becomes 
harder to understand in either scenario.

It's be good to see how, perhaps, sticking to strictly music-related 
functionality will avoid these sorts of problems - do you have any 
further examples/ideas?

	The parser allows more straightforward statements; the above would
probably be "if the expression ends with a question mark, end the
expression with an exclamation point". Everything is completely
grammatical, and there's no need for compoundWords, (gratuitous spaces),
or <clause> delimited clauses </clause>. But I know what you mean. :)

	Yeah, I think the trickiest thing for me in this context will be trying
to do everything as a series of one-liners. It seems doable, though,
especially given the ability to "look" at what's been done so far, so as
not to lose track of things.

> do you have any further examples/ideas?

	Well, when I was thinking about using a special room for "preshow"
music, I started thinking about manipulating prerecorded material, and
expressions like "slow the pitch to 50%", "play backwards", "enqueue 'A
Hard Day's Night'", and so on. Also, the idea of "taking" musical
elements and carrying them from one room to another is appealing. And I
plan to use heavily the ability to move between different scopes of a
musical structure, to tweak things. E.g.:

***

the score> speak to the third note of the thirty-first measure

	Hi, a note here.

a note> your pitch is A4

	Okay.

***

(While the score is playing, of course.)

	What I plan to do now is just run the thing, try to keep it
interesting, and record the transcripts for people to review (which
hopefully will lead to more suggestions).

	Actually telling some sort of story over the course of a show
(improvised, ideally) would be a lot of fun.


	thanks again,

-C

by Tom Betts and Joe Gilmore.

rand()% is commissioned by Media Centre Network.

rand()%lab is a presentation by the generative
net.radio station, rand()%, applied to a gallery
context. The installation uses the laboratory as
a metaphor for research and investigation into
random number generation and sound. The exhibition
will feature new audio works by rand()% artists
Tom Betts, Joe Gilmore, Alku, James Brouwer
and Mileece, installed for the first time in a
physical location.

Various experiments will be presented: the
results of ongoing investigations into quantum
random numbers, mutant Unix code and bio-acoustic
research. By using sensor technologies and
software agents to take signal feeds from plants,
light, the quantum decay of beta particles, lemons,
and data packet sniffing from information systems,
new audio experiments are created.

The artists and their collaborators will evolve
the experiments and processes over the two month
duration of the exhibition.

Visitors will be able to listen to the rand()%
live stream via headphone listening posts, and
browse exisiting rand()% works which have a
previously unseen accompanying visual element,
including works by rand()% collaborators:

Hi all,

I guess that recordings of live coding jams is not really the done thing, but
sod it, I've got another here:

http://www.archive.org/audio/audio-details-db.php?collection=opensource_audio&collectionid=weft3

So, this has multiple lsystem patterns with independant tempo. Also a brand
new super-simple drumsynth, and the drum patterns all done in exactly the same
way as the melodies - which are using an Iranian tuning system in this track.

The score code language now has a "sync next pattern" command, that resets the
next pattern back to it's beginning - so things dont (completly) spiral into
chaos. You get quite interesting behaviours by playing with this, and the
ordering of the patterns - but this is still under development...

cheers,

dave

Live "stepping through a debugger" might be more descriptive - I'm not
entirely kidding - I think program flow should be made obvious to the
audience too, this is why I like the idea of machine code instructions,
or even simpler building blocks where the action is more apparent:
http://www.logiblocs.com/logi-orange.htm :) 

I guess I don't see live coding as being about typing or languages, but
essentially about demonstrating a beautiful process that also
sounds/looks{/smells?} good as a side effect.

Maybe I'm a crazy heretic.

Hope you're ok though, alex!

Not yet.  For now, you can tweak the parameters that control
how the spectrum is rendered and even change viewing angle.
Once we get this into ChucK (via GLucK or the Audicle), then
we can do a lot more with it.  For now, it's just fun to put up
for people to look at along with us typing (sometimes
incompetently).  What is our stance on combining non-livecode
software with state-approved systems during performance?
To me, it seems that it is OK as long as it augments and doesn't
take the place of the on-the-fly experience.  Having something
like sndpeek is a good thing in this case.  What do you think,
people?

Best,

Maybe we should put out a licence (lcl) that disallows linking to any 
non live coding system..

I don't see much point in trying to keep performace as pure as 
possible. The question is more what the intentions of presenting the 
text on stage are. I could imagine that someone working on a poem on 
stage while a tape plays 'Les sons et les parfums tournent dans l'air 
du soir' by Debussy.
The main thing in my view is a certain perspective on language that 
programming can change when it is done interactively.

Heh, I agree.  It's easy, and perhaps useful to make idealistic
statements like "If software isn't written live, or interacted with,
then it is not a performance."  While I these statements are useful for
discussion and self-reflection, I don't think they should bind anyone.

For me presenting the text is allowing the listener to see some of the
movement that makes the music.  If they can see the text being typed and
chopped around then they can hopefully feel able to open themselves to
the music as something that is alive in some sense.

Last night I heard someone play music from an ipod that they said they
made using astrophysics.  Normally I wouldn't take it seriously but in
this case I trusted the musician, because I knew him.  I didn't make the
connection between the music and the twin pulsar systems that he was
sampling from using a radio telescope, but I was able to take it on
trust and listen to the music as very nice, carefully made music.

However in general I can't trust blank face behind a hidden laptop
screen.

To be honest I am sceptical about whether reading and understanding the
code that a livecoder is making could really enhance the musical
experience.  The interactions between musical processes are more
interesting than the musical processes themselves (the whole being
greater than the sum) but you can only read one thing at a time [1].  So
perhaps it's better not to read one subroutine at a time, and to instead
listen to all of them at once.

Anyway, this all somehow becomes irrelevant if people are dancing, the
focus then hopefully being away from the performer.

Excuse me if I am coming across a bit vague, I'm coming off a general
anaesthetic!

[1] From "The raft" by Jose Saramago (in translation):

"Writing is extremely difficult, it is an enormous responsibility, you
need only think of the exhausting work involved in setting out events in
chronological order, first this one, then that, or, if considered more
convenient to achieve the right effect, today's event placed before
yesterday's episode, and other no less risky acrobatics, the past
treated as if it were new, the present as a continuous process without
any present or ending, but, however hard writers might try, there is one
feat they cannot achieve, that is to put into writing, in the same
tense, two events which have occurred simultaneously. Some believe the
difficulty can be solved by dividing the page into two columns, side by
side, but this strategy is ingenuous, because the one was written first
and the other afterwards, without forgetting that the reader will have
to read this one first and then the other one, or vice versa, the people
who come off best are the opera singers, each with his or her own part
to sing, three, four, five, six between tenors, basses, sopranos and
baritones, all singing different words, for example, the cynic mocking,
the ingenue pleading, the gallant lover slow in coming to her aid, what
interests the opera-goer is the music, but the reader is not like this,
he wants everything explained, syllable by syllable and one after the
other, as they are shown here."

Perhaps this doesn't apply to a computer, which can have or emulate
multiple processes.  But does it apply to a human reading code or not?

If that is true, then why do we (toplap) exist?  =)

I understand your skepticism, but I like to believe and sincerely hope 
that
reading and understanding the code CAN truly enhance the musical
experience (you do too, I am sure) - at least in the same way of
watching/appreciating performances of traditional musical instruments.

How we can achieve this is part of our research challenge.  It depends
on the syntax/semantic of the language/tool.  Maybe, say
LisP/ML/(and SC, to a good extent) can be hard to grok on screen, but it
doesn't have to be that way.  One of the our primary goals in ChucK
is to make expressive, READABLE audio programs.  And indeed, the
way timing works in ChucK allows readers to follow timing the exact
way as following program flow:

--
// connect impulse (train) generator to dac
impulse i => dac;

// infinite time loop
while( true )
{
     // set next sample to 1.0
     1.0 => i.next;

     // advance time by 80 samples
     80::samp => now;
}
---

You can follow the control structures and know exactly what and
WHEN things are happening (generating a impulse train with period
of 80 samples).  Pair this with concurrency, and it allows you to
follow parallel flows and you can reason about timing in a
synchronous way across the entire system.

Of course, this alone is probably not enough and there are other things
that we can do to get the understanding across - like visualization
the coding process and how code is running in the system at run-time
http://audicle.cs.princeton.edu/

One of our goals is to make code a live instrument by conveying
the intent of the musician to the audience, and to give the audience
an opportunity to appreciate the process of realizing that intent.  It 
is
this lack of perceivable intent that really make most computer music
utterly meaningless in live performance.  We don't know if the performer
succeeds in his/her gestures at any level because we don't know what
those gestures are.

The ability to understand and appreciate code is central because
code is our gesture.  I believe we must try to get this part right.

Okay, I stop typing now.

Best,
Ge!

yes, I would agree that these kind of statements do not lead very far.
What is a 'performance' depends to a large degree on the context - 
and if something is set up as performance it is likely to be 
considered one.

The question is when you hear a change in music that seems to be 
somehow externally caused you will try to relate it to something. 
Dependent on the change and the expectation you might relate it to a 
slider movement, a new preset loaded into the program, or a change in 
a text that stands for the sound. Reading the text might, and this is

I think reading is not a process that really resembles a line from A to B.
Specially when reading code (or magazines) it resembles much a strolling about,
having a look at this, then at this - with the knowledge of each 
forming the context for the next. It turns out to be quite a wild 
montage of various bits of understanding. Even if reading a novel 
usually means going from one word to the next just as from one page 
to the next, this does not mean that the understanding builds up this 
way - an extreme case is maybe modern literature, but also many 
philosophic texts are more like a sculpture that wants to be looked 
at in various moments of the day, in different light situations. Live 
coding seems to me like an interaction with a kinetic sculpture, 
which can be only understood really by changing it. If code is an 
instrument, then playing it means changing it, if it is an 
environment, then understanding is means constructing experiments in 
it. In a novel I can make deductions - I can predict and retrodict 
events and reasons for behaviour. I would find it interesting to see 
the search for such experiments and causalities becoming a stronger 
part of perceiving algorithmic music.

I think "side effect" is an understatement.  The sound/visual/odour is
the way we experience the process with our bodies, so it's quite
important as a medium.  I think it important to experience processes
with our whole bodies, not just our minds...

You can understand a lot of things about a traditional musical 
instrument
being played, most relevant to our comparison:

     - you see/hear how gestures of the performers translate to sound
       (there are exceptions - such as pipe organs)
     - you often have a sense when the instrument sounds bad, or
       poorly played
     - If you are a experienced player in the instrument, you are more
       capable of appreciating virtuosic playing

what kind of understanding are you referring to?

If you can read code through control flow, then it's possible to 
understand
at least one flow, if the language/system lends itself to that.  
Parallel flow is
harder, but if you can parse a band into component parallel members, 
then
maybe it's possible and interesting to do so with code.

Perhaps the better word is "gesture", though intention is crucial, but
more on the level of "what sound/music gesture am I trying to make".

As far as performance is concerned, it's the difference between hearing
Miles Davis live - and hearing Miles Davis live but with Miles playing
from inside an opaque box onstage.  I want to see the performer interact
with the instrument.  Computers are unique because it is both the
instrument and a performer.  To see this interaction, seeing the code
helps.  Furthermore, there should be the opportunity for the code to
be understood (for experienced members of the audience) in order
to enhance (intellectually, musically, gesturally) the appreciation.

because the end goal is to make meaningful and virtuosic sound/music,
not to sonify code (though that can be a neat recursive live coding -
on-the-fly programming of sonification of the live code itself).

i think this is a really interesting comment, because there's a couple 
ways to look at this. from one perspective i agree, but i usually find 
myself saying just the opposite when explaining my interest in livecoding 
performance to someone who says, "but it's of no use to someone who can't 
understand the code!" 

to me what's interesting about watching someone perform a traditional
(mechanically-operated) instrument is that even if you don't play that
instrument or know anything about it, you still understand how it makes
music. you can see/hear the causality of the performer's motions and the
music you hear, and that's what makes it exciting. performances in which
things get more kinetic are usually the most exciting, and that is played
out in both visuals and sound.

on the other hand, a person who plays that instrument will have a more
sophisticated level of appreciation for the performance. but, in some
cases, the knowledgable audience member will be so far inside the process
they won't be able to enjoy the performance viscerally at all.

what i personally find most interesting about livecoding performance
usually is not trying to understand the code that's being typed. what i
find most interesting is the kinetic relationship between what i see on
the screen and what i hear. i like slub a lot e.g., because even though it
may not be considered pure livecoding, there's a lot of action on the
screen, and a lot of clear relationships between the onscreen activity and
the sound produced - so i get a sense of the *motion* of the processes.
with livecoding that involves longer bits of code being developed
onscreen, more of the "innards" of the process are shown but
paradoxically, i get less of a sense of that process as a piece of music
in motion.

so the tricky thing for me with livecoding becomes balancing the
presentation of internal kineticism (the motion within the process that
motivated the performer to livecode in the first place) with external
kineticism (a cause-effect relationship between the visual and the aural
aspects of the performance.) 

this of course assumes that we're trying to work within the model of how
mechanical instruments are performed and the audience's experience with
that model. it's also possible to try to move livecoding away from that
model just as early films eventually made the move away from documentation
of stage plays toward a medium-specific model using montage, camera
angles, time compression, etc.... and how software art tries to move away
from the display-centric model of video and media art.  in that case, the
challenge becomes figuring out how the audience will come to relate to the
new model, whether there first needs to be a gradual transition and
development of increased literacy of the medium, or whether it can happen
right away.

my approach with the thingee has been decidely/admittedly non-purist,
especially since i don't much trust myself to type long bits of code
correctly onstage, or even figure out where my typos are quickly in a live
situation. so i've just gone for the overall effect - combining livecoding
with quickly-executed parameterized commands, and even some foot-stomps
through FIFOSY (FIFOSY Is Foot-Operated Software Ya-know)... plus some
actual livecode that acts on whatever text is clicked, so that the
onscreen action of clicking can cause something immediate to happen, while
still being part of a livecode process (though the process itself may not
really be obvious enough live.)

btw, i actually did write an actual livecode FIFOSY implementation into
the thingee, wherein you can assign an arbitrary snippet of livecode to a
square on the dancepad, and then when you hit that square with your foot
again, it will spit the code back onto the screen, which thus causes it to
be executed. but it was too rough to try to do at the aarhus show, and i'm
not sure i'll ever use it because it's pretty difficult to get people to
understand any causality with a maneuver like that... 

oh well, foot in, foot out...

What about coloring the code line wich is being
executed differently? Like many debuggers do... 
And do that for all the threads (or scripts) that are
playing? Arrange them in the screen(s).
The viewer/listener could try to relate one sound
pattern to one of the threads?

To be readable i guess it would be necessary to
sleep(some time) on every codeline. bluerg!

PixelACHE 2005
Electronic art and subcultures festival
14-17 April, Helsinki

CALL FOR PROJECTS

PixelACHE explores again the fringe areas of electronic art. The festival
program consists of concerts, clubs, project showcases, workshops and pan=
el
discussions.

We invite artists and designers, engineers and architects, researchers an=
d
activists, professionals and students - all kinds of people involved in
experimenting with new and old technologies - to send us project
descriptions and ideas! The deadline for proposals for PixelACHE 2005
 is November 15th 2004! More information about the submission
 process is available on the PixelACHE website at www.pixelache.ac.

THEME 2005 : DOT ORG BOOM

* The Boom that happened when the media wasn't listening *

The years around the turn of the millennium were the glory days of the do=
t
coms. New media industry promised a shiny future and acted as a platform
for a great gamble which involved fantastic sums of real and virtual mone=
y.
These days seem like a distant past when one listens to the news today -
reports of downsizing and fear of economic depression have replaced the o=
nce
optimistic views of the future.

Hidden from the radar of the mainstream media, another boom has been
silently growing and gaining a stronger position in the development of
media, technology and culture. Dot Org Boom is the non-profit, cultural
version of the dot com boom. It brings together voluntary efforts of a
massive amount of individual people and is based on the ideology
of sharing instead of the ideology of owning.

:----

PIXELACHE SUBTHEMES

PixelACHE festival program will be based on a new structure this year. In
addition to the program which is based on the annual theme (Dot Org Boom)=
,
we have decided to include some additional program categories. These
categories are:

- Experimental sound & interaction and electronics
- VJ culture
- Interactive and participatory cinema
- Grassroot networks and politics of media / technology

The projects in these categories do not necessarily have to be related to
the Dot Org Boom theme - we are interested in all kinds of innovative and
experimental projects. In the same way as before, we also take into
consideration project concepts which are still in the early planning stag=
e.

PIXELACHE WORKSHOPS

PixelACHE festival will feature several workshops organized together with
both local and international collaborators. Currently confirmed workshops
are the particle/wave hybrid radio workshop, PixelACHE goes Television
workshop and VJ culture and audiovisual performance tools workshop.

particle/wave hybrid radio workshop explores the interface between the
creative traditions of terrestial radio broadcasting and emerging practic=
es
of internet radiomaking. particle/wave rethinks community radio practices
through distributed and participatory networks of sonic exchange, open
content models and new radiomaking tools. It examines the dual nature of
radio as wave/packet, network/sound, transmission/reception. particle/wav=
e
is coordinated by Sophea Lerner and organised in collaboration with Sibel=
ius
Academy, Centre for Music & Technology.
http://aura.siba.fi/particlewave

VJ culture and audiovisual storytelling workshop explores the connections
between VJ culture, filmmaking and theatre. The workshop tutors include
theatre directors, audiovisual designers and participants from the piksel=
04
event (www.piksel.no), an annual workshop which specializes in developing
open source audiovisual performance software. The workshop also connects =
to
the PixelACHE goes Television workshop.

Pixelache goes Television workshop will search for new and fresh approach=
es
to an old medium. The local television channel called Dina in Arabia
district of Helsinki is open for projects to be broadcasted. The area of

yeah, on the whole, I think this would be a useful addition to live coding
environments, but it's hard. In my music app for instance, there is a lot of
seperation between the sequencer and the interface that would make this
difficult, as they are different processes - you could do it, but getting the
timing right would be very hard... 

but this is just a technical issue.

in some ways it just doesn't make sense - in fluxus if you stepped through the
code it wouldn't really tell you that much about what was going on, it's not
really a linear process that you'd make much sense of. most of the scripts in
fluxus are no longer than 10 or 20 lines anyway, so you'd just get the
recursive looping a couple of lines and a slideshow framerate. in this case
it's more informative to read the small amount of code.

OTOH, another advantage to the virtual machine approach is the ability to view
the contents of memory and registers as the code is running, this is as
important to understanding the process as view the code IMHO, and in a very
small (virtual) processor, quite simple to display and understand.  

this is why I like the idea of editing code "inside" the machine a line at a
time as it's running, rather than updating the code in chunks that get
uploaded to replace a running process. doing in-processor livecoding has a lot
of disadvantages, being much more error prone and there are a lot of higher
level things you couldn't do easily with a small instruction set at a slow
speed, but it certainly makes the process somewhat more direct.

another idea is to look at universal machines that could be programmed
visually so that the description, process and the execution are the same -
conway's "life" springs to mind - you could have pixels that trigger sounds,
and build glider guns to fire patterns at them.... you can build the basic
logic gates out of glider guns and glider "eaters" I believe. 

there is also Toshio Iwai's music insects, which could be seen as live
programming, now I come to think of it:

Yes, you can build all logic gates with glider guns, gliders and some 
special configurations that react to them. I've seen at least calculations 
of how large a Life simulation of (some generation of) the Pentium 
processor would be.

We are trying to do this now with the Audicle - our approach is map 
instructions
to ChucK statements, and have the ChucK statements "glow" as executed.  
The
VM is polled at a aperiodic rate (to avoid phase locks with control 
flow) to figure
what instruction is being executed.

Yes.  Right now we don't have good things to show for it, but working 
hard to
look into all we can do with ChucK VM - there is a gigantic amount, 
thanks to
Moore's Law.

I can't help thinking we've come in a full circle. There's something 
decidedly 1996 CD-ROM Multimedia-ish about talking about making music 
with walking pixels and cellular automata. Yes, maybe some of these 
ideas might constitute livecoding scenarios, but let's not forget where 
we came from.

TOPLAP is - for me - a move away from the soundtoys, the instant music 
makers, the generative music tools, the quirky combinations of ideas. I 
think TOPLAP needs to firmly reject these in order to maintain it's 
foothold on the central thesis that is... software production is music 
authorship.

some years ago I wrote a fairly additive synthesis system (actually 
simply a parametric grid) that could be driven via turing machines 
(not cellular automata) on a 2D plane:

http://swiki.hfbk-hamburg.de:8888/MusicTechnology/133

you could change the interpretation of the data on the fly.
I haven't had the time to port that to a newer system yet though.

If it's used in a way that takes advantage of it's universal machine status -
not just for it's random pretty colours, ie you were to build mechanisms that
(for instance) passed gliders to and fro to create a complex system - you'd be
programming it in a deterministic way. 

The reason this would be better than a written language is that the audience
would immediately understand what you were doing - you'd see the process
working, not the *description* of the process in an abstract computer language. 

I think this is the central point I'm badly trying to describe :)

For me, idealistically it's about total exposure of a performance to the
audience. It's about laying your algorithms on the table face up to show whats
going on. I don't think it has anything to do with what you use to do that -
if it's a java app soundtoy that you can reconfigure openly to operate
differently - so be it.

I suppose I don't see programming as being about typing and text editors.
That's just the interface to programming.

Perhaps we disagree - how exciting! :)

I wonder if the idea of immediacy carries very far here. Althogh it 
might be of considerate appeal (really!) to see what is "really" 
going on, say in the registers of a vm, it does not necessarily mean 
anything. But you are right that we are facing here the difficulty of 
language which can in some cases be by introducing a visualization. 
This visualization should, in my view, be considered on the same 
level as the music, thus, in a certain respect, secondary to code.

Interesting. I'm hopeless at this sort of theorising, so bear with me. 

I like visualisations of processes, I think the process is the thing of
value, as you can write a bubble sort in any language under the sun -
it's the process of it being carried out that's cool, surely?

Ok, am I wrong? Is a bubble sort more interesting/have more value
written as perl, or ZX80 asm, or whitespace? Is your descision based
more on the characters used to describe the same algorithm? If this is
the case, then why bother running it? :/

You're informed by the process then, not the code itself.
The code is a tool to shape the process - not an end unto itself to hang
on the wall.

I think it's by displaying a process as it's happening that's going to
make non programmer audiences understand live coding, not handing out
reference manuals in a nightclub so they can follow the code :)

Well if two people were to make a bubblesort then visualise it in the
same way, then I bet it would look different, I still think the detail
is in the implementation.  Which direction do you travel in?  Where do
you restart from?  What state do you keep, and how do you know where
your work is done as a result?  The bubblesort is a well-defined
algorithm but still, I remember having to make decisions when I was
programming them in college.  Sometimes this detail seems more important
to me than the algorithm itself.

Through live coding practice, I find myself recoding the same ideas or
algorithms over and over again, but still they come out different every
time.  

In practice I bother running my code because while I will have an idea
of it in my head, I don't know what it's going to do in the real world. 
I run the code, see the results, change the code and repeat.  Live
coding makes this action and reaction immediate.  This is not a process
of debugging (a well practiced programmer doesn't spend their time
clearing up after bum notes), it's a process of authorship through
manipulation of code.

I agree that the code is a tool to shape the process, but it's also true
that the process is a tool to shape the code.  I don't like to separate
the code and the process, the code is the process in written form.

I agree with that.  But I'd also say that they might also understand it
just by hearing the process work without visualisations.

On the other hand I still think the audience should be allowed to
observe what the performer is doing, if they are performing in front of
them.  I feel a discussion about revealing aspects of a running process
visually is separate from this.

Exactly my point I think - so surely steps to make the mechanics of the
process obvious are needed to truely understand whats going on if you don't
understand the programming language. That's our most challenging task I
reckon. People aren't ever going to take the time to try to read code and
understand it during a live code performance (unless they are sober, and
already programmers) however, a dynamic process that doesn't look obscure and
 geek chic is much more appealing. We're hiding our processes behind our
programming languages otherwise, and just saying - look at us, you can't
understand, but we're immensely clever!

The word visualisation is a bad one - the process could well be audible - but
I think we need to work a lot harder at this than just triggering notes and
setting parameters using a text editor.

Thinking about it - my whole POV in this thread is based on the assumption
that we want people to understand. If we are just using livecoding as a better
way to make music - which is perfectly valid IMHO, then it's not important -
but then why project screens?

I think in a way though that the transparency of a performance is more
interesting for the audience, and likely to grab their attention. It's scary
somehow too, and therefore exciting.

Feedback from the Arhus gig indicated this too.

Hmm, for me at least I think there's a confusion between several
statements:

statement one: 
The process should be visible or audible in such a way that people
should be able to see/hear what the process is doing.

statement two: 
The process should be visible or audible in such a way that people
should be able to understand how the process was made (or is being
made).

statement three: 
The process should be visible or audible in such a way that people
should be able to understand how the process is working.

I think I most identify with statement one.  As programmer the code is
very important but for the audience what it is doing (or what i'm doing
through it) is what they're mostly concerned with.

Statement two means people have to read and understand your code
manuscripts.  This is what I am not sure is useful.

Statement three is what I think we've been talking about most recently -
animated debuggers, visualisations where sound is primary, sonifications
where visuals are primary, etc.  But underneath, I think this is really
the same as statement one; what we're doing here is just making a
multimedia performance.

The aims behind both statement one and statement three are to avoid
smoke and mirrors, and create something that allows people direct access
to whatever you're trying to create.

Statement two seems very different, expecting the audience to be
interested in how you made something, not just what you made.

> but then why project screens?

So the audience don't feel excluded, which they might be if they're
lined up sat in chairs looking at you.  They're less likely to feel
excluded if they're dancing around on a dancefloor, so it's less
important to project screens in that situation, in my opinion.

This is shaky ground because you seem to be using TOPLAP's manifesto to 
make a stand against the theatrical elements of a musical performance 
(by saying that smoke and mirrors are a bad thing). Actually, illusion 
is a key factor of many performances, and music and theatre are by no 
means mutually exclusive; there are elements of either in both.

I think what's more useful is to point out that musical performances 
often deploy _poor_ theatrical devices, and that TOPLAP advocates the 
use of code (in whatever form) as _another_ layer of potential 
communication in any performance.

I guess smoke and mirrors isn't quite the right term.  I did not mean to
campaign against illusion or theatrics.

I had in mind overuse of special effects to make the dull seem
interesting, for example the altzero series by squidsoup, wild lens
flare type effects around a spinning globe of fire, obscuring the fact
that you're controlling a set of volume sliders mapped onto a poor two
dimensional control.

Your point does complicate things a great deal though - can we say that
we are opening up processes while at the same time creating illusions? 
Or are the processes illusions themselves?

Hmm, good point... hadn't thought of it in a theatrical sense...

arg, I suppose I just take the toplap ideal to be about de-mystifying the
computer art experience, as it's become infested with secretive types all
doing the same thing. 

You can't hide the process of playing a trumpet (well you could but people
dont tend to :) ) onlookers can gather information about how you're doing it
and be inspired - inspired by the whole package, the performance _and_ the
sounds. We just need some of that honesty.

With a trumpet the act and the sound are inseperable and immediate, with a
computer they are not.

I think I'm taking it too far - it's enough just to show that you are
operating on something, which at the most has a visual indication of
complexity (amount of code) which relates somehow to the complexity of the result.

I'd still like to aim for Alex's "statement three" though. This may have more
in common with something like kinetic art than a performance though.

Really need to shut up now and do some work ;)

I don't see much the difference between statement 2
and 3 when livecoding. Because the construction of the
process is part of the process itself. To undertand
programmer's decisions on changing the state of the
runnig scripts(or other stuff) is important to the
undertanding of the music generation process as a
whole. Am I right?

which would be a great ida btw.

this is a little branch out, because alex has brought into play quite 
useful ways of clarifying. Nevertheless..

As mentioned before, interactive programming is not only something 
that is done on stage. For me it primarily is something that is done 
alone, in pairs, as a way to communicate about sound and make sound 
at the same time. Thinking about it in this way, the problem here is 
not so severe, although also present (do I understand what I program? 
do the two programmers understand each other?).
Whether it makes sense to lift the whole process on stage is an 
interesting discussion, but I think this needs a more detailed 
description of the circumstances and the reasons why the program is 
done live and why someone should be involved in that process somehow.

One reason for me is to do it is that I think to promote intellectual 
activity as something public and cultural has become a political 
issue. The mirror of intellectual feudalism seems to be an aversion 
towards free thinking. Btw. a great performer who works in this 
direction is LKJ (Linton Kwesi Johnson).
The old days of the Smalltalk language, the great ideal it was to 
teach all children how to program, just as they are able to write and 
read, because it was considered something everyone should be able to 
do. Live coding can be work in this direction.

This relates interestingly to extreme programming - something else I've been
involved with on and off on various projects. One of the tenets being that
programmers work in pairs, sharing one computer and writing much more
effective code than two alone put together.

I played a gig this weekend and despite the performance being being lackluster
and plodding (it went quite badly overall), it never the less caused quite a
lot of questions and interest based solely on the code used and what on earth
I was doing... I think for me maybe this is more important than performing
well or making people dance (which maybe a good job ;))...

I'm thinking of handing out little fliers containing a guide to the melody
language thing at gigs in future.

I like this mentality a lot - I think livecoding (and maybe a language in a
more general sense) will be only be considered useful when kids can do it too.

I think you are right in so far as the whole process includes every 
participant, including listener, programmer, the language, the 
electricity, the air, the history of music, and so on.

transparency is a beautiful illusion, understanding is an artistic material.

I think part of what those guys are interested in is algorithms that
respond to human input, which is fine in my book - as they are searching
for better ways of controlling complex things in more gestural ways - I
quite like that way of working. It's not strictly autonomous though.

Ok, I find zero input autonomous stuff really irritating. Randomness
alone means nothing (in some cases that may be the point, but it's
pretty boring) ie AARON - what on earth is that all about? (no offence,
but I'd really like to know, it doesn't even produce nice pictures...) 

I find this kind of stuff far more interesting:
http://helen.cs-i.brandeis.edu/pr/buildable/long_bridge/
It's autonomous, but you have to give it a problem, and a set of rules,
and some time, and it provides a solution - that's generative art in my
book, or perhaps I'm too much of a computer scientist.

We shouldn't be too extremist. I use lots of different mechansims for
live music generation, including live coding, genetic programming and
good old slider tweaking. Is this wrong?

Agreed, but that approach puts great distance between the creator of a
process and the process itself.  Would it be fair to say that TOPLAP are
for the humanisation of the process?

No I don't think so.  It should be possible for TOPLAP to have an well
defined position while comfortably sharing a world with generative
artists.

What I think is a shame is that artificial intelligence and generative
autonomous art gets an awful lot of 'airplay' in the cultural and
research institutions.  To me, TOPLAP's position is actually less
extreme, trying to promote the use of computers more comparable to the
use of traditional musical instruments, for making immediate, hands-on
sound.

And in fact this position allows us to be far more open to the rest of
the world than the autonomous generative art position.  A generative
musician can't go down the pub and jam with another musician, but a
toplap live coding musician can, because they have the same immediate
control.

i think it illustrates two ways of looking at the idea of an "algorithm." 
their idea is the more traditional research-oriented idea: can an 
algorithm resemble/replace a thinking human? toplap's idea is that we're the 
humans and algorithms are something that humans "do", like making 
music or making images. 
they: algorithms =~ humans ... we: algorithms =~ musical instruments.
and/or 
they: composition-related interest in algorithms
we: performance-related interest in algorithms


as to dave's question about AARON: that was the idea... how much like an 
independently painting human could AARON become? the interest was in how, 
over the years, cohen could give it increasingly less information about 
what or how to paint, and it could make increasingly independent 
"subjective" decisions. but what i think is most interesting was that of 
course AARON's paintings exhibited cohen's aesthetics... so the 
independence with which it could paint was juxtaposed by its strong 
dependence on obviously very subjective algorithms written by its 
author. AARON's success was that cohen didn't just program it - he 
brainwashed it, which i like very much as it brought out that very 
important subjective aspect to AI...

i agree, it's just that other position is of more interest in academia as 
it's more readily understood as research. toplap's position might seem 
more generally accessible, but it's a bit less accessible as an academic 
pursuit. on the other hand, research-oriented people do seem interested in 
the toplap approach as well, as it represents research into new modes of 
performance.

true, and i think this is why it appeals more to us, or at least some of 
us - because we're focused on performance.  although they perform live, i 
think the livealgorithms' group's interest is really more in the 
compositional aspects of the system... i.e., *what* the computer will play 
when another performer plays X, rather than *how* it will play it live. 

although the human performers are improvising with the computer, the 
computer doesn't really "know" it's improvising live...  it knows that 
it's accepting input in real-time, but it doesn't care about the 
"liveness" of its output. unless it's a very complex algorithm, a computer 
will output the same thing whether you give it 5 seconds or a week to 
think about it - i'm not sure the word "improvise" can really be applied 
to a computer... this is where the toplap "human" approach is much different 
- it sure as heck makes a difference that we're "outputting" live...

the group or how the systems work.)

Although as Julian often points out, we are interested in composition
too.  We just compose using live algorithms rather than building
algorithms then shocking them into life every now and then.

It's the difference between making a wind sculpture in the dulled
environment of your living room, then hanging it out in the wind to see
what happens, or hanging a piece of string from a tree on a windy
hillside and building it right there, with every compositional action in
immediate reaction to the real world.

There doesn't have to be an audience.

There seems to be a lot of hot air around the generative approach to
music.  A human writes some software, runs the software, the software
makes music.  This triggers surprise and joy, wow, where did this music
come from?  Is there somehow a human inside my computer?  Has my
computer become human?  What an interesting research opportunity!

This position seems to miss the obvious, that the programmer is human,
that's where the intelligence and the creativity came from.  Maybe some
people find it difficult to accept that programmers have these
attributes.

I've been enjoying people's discussion of this. I ponder a bit myself below.

Cognitive models of improvisation can be explored on computer in a live 
setting as participants. This gives some very interesting possibilities. 
Because the models are bound to be very complicated, there would be no hope 
of programming them live, preparation beforehand (including possible 
supervised training) is necessary. They may also contain unsupervised 
learning capabilities for the performance, and I would hope interact with 
human musicians in a sensitive way.

Their liveness makes sense in terms of their models of human cognition of 
music and the fact they interact with humans. The devil's advocate would 
run them against each other in a band.

The future TOPLAPPER might devise an AI which live codes, but I fear 
fundamental issues of consciousness and human intelligence might delay this 
work...as they delay models of traditional music making too of course.

Alex's point that human programming effort goes into their construction is 
of course valid, and the same point is made I think by Doug Hofstader about 
computer chess programs- it's amazing we can theorise and construct about 
such things, there is no shame or threat in their autonomy.

> (nick please correct me if i've misunderstood either the interests of

I don't know the group properly yet, but I'll try to attend their first 
meeting in December.

The more cognitive science I discover, the more inspired I am. I don't know 
how deeply the members of LAN feel this; perhaps some feel it deeply as an 
artistic field for exploration, others just enter trendy areas like 
connectionism to grab research results compatible with existing biases in 
the academic field.

I am torn because I like live coding as an interfacing method for 
electronic music improvisation; but I am also developing automated systems 
with perceptually motivated signal processing. I get round this right now 
by controlling the parameters and the uses of the output of the complex 
algorithms (those which have to be done in advance) through live code. 
Either approach definitely involves humans, and I still feel algorithmic 
composition is human. The question is just how effectively a model 
understands human perception and production of music.

I think livecoding is a very pragmatic and in your face idea, it seems
quite punk rock to generative art's prog rock.

or something...

I guess it make a bit more sense in that context. However, intelligence
(or the appearence of it) comes from something reacting to the world,
and I think it's hard to claim AARON has much to say about AI when it's
so linear - it would be a much more interesting experiment to make an AI
art critic, I'm sure it's out there somewhere :)

a computer will always output the same thing given the same input, no
matter how complex the algorithm, as it's entirely, utterly, boringly
deterministic. thats why we're so odd. or are our inputs just much more
complicated? etc etc...

whatever, there seems to be a range of possibilities from banging two
rocks together to make a song, all the way to worrying about building an
entire brain that knows how to bangs rocks together to make a song, and
we're somewhere in the middle :)

it would be a great livecoding environment, although it would be

this was the point of my AARON story: the value of AARON is in the fact 
that it paints just like its daddy. it doesn't paint like "a human" it 
paints like a *specific* human: the one who programmed it. so it makes 
this point exactly.... like some humans who purport to be independent 
thinkers but are in fact overly-influenced by the opinions of others, 
AARON may make individual decisions "independently", but it's clear where 
it gets its mindset from.

yes, there are AI art critics - more about that later... 

not sure what you mean about linearity, but remember AARON is a 30 year 
old project so the discourse around AI was a bit more limited at the time 
it started... 

but i guess i've probably responded more or less to your question in 
previous mail: i.e., i think what it says about AI is that AI's 
intelligence is the product of its human programmers (because AARON shares 
its *programmer's* aesthetic sense.) it makes this very point about the 
subjectivity/bias/humanness of algorithms. for me, that's interesting on 
two levels: a) forces people to question their assumptions about AI 
(which are usually that it's mechanical/mysterious/incomprehensible and so 
therefore, we're forced to be submissive toward it) and b) forces people 
to question how often humans behave like AI's (presume to think 
independently but in fact behave as conditioned.)

hee hee hee.. yes, this is my favorite question. how often do people make 
"independent" decisions influenced by a strong and targeted conditioning 
(programming)? this is a question relevant to political propagandizing, 
among other things... and why use of the word "deprogramming" has expanded 
beyond the realm of outcast religious cults. 

as to AI art critics - i can think of at least one off the top of my head 
(gabor papp's conoisseur)... and there are also AI academics 
(postmodernism generator), AI politicians (bush bot), AI bloggers (blog 
bitch), and more... have a look through runme's artifial intelligence and 
text manipulation sections for other funny/critical approaches to AI... 
but what's interesting about most of these is that the critical point they 
make is not how much AI's can act like humans, but how much humans can act 
like AI's...

It's also affected its author's mindset: Harold Cohen wasn't a 
figurative artist. And he now says it's a better colourist than he was. 
So whilst it's very much Cohen's (interestingly so), over time it's 
become more of a collaborator than an overly impressionable student.

I think that AARON works as a kind of existence proof for Cohen's 
cognitive science ideas about art, which do seem to have been ahead of 
their time. It also, unintentionally,  works as a psychologically 
interesting series of images that say something about Harold Cohen (and 
the world he's looking at). Much more than most contemporary art says 
anything.

Subject: [livecode] toplap at club transmediale
From: Jan Rohlf <jan


hi at toplap,

hi alex or adrian (if this mail reaches you, I cc it to some other addresses
I have to make sure to reach you),

we have recieved the toplap submission. Thanks for that.

Now we would like to include you with a presentation and/or live coding
audio visual performance in a program, which at the moment is named "Live
Cinema". This program will be a series of panels, presentations, workshops,
screenings and performances investigating into the conceptual interplay of
live generated sound and image, hold at both the venues of club transmediale
and transmediale. We have identified several themes we would like to
discuss/present. Amongst them will be <The Philosophy of "live"> and <The
Role of Running Code>. It seems interesting to include toplap and its
statement/intent in one of these themes.

Would you be available on Sunday February 6th or on Monday February 7th?
Who would/could be part of toplap at club transmediale? From where would
they travel? Of course I immediatly thought about the combination of Alex
McLean and Adrian Ward, as I know both their work. But toplap seems to be a
bunch of people, so maybe you have other ideas. It is just that the budget
is of course limited, so that we might not be able to bring over many
members of toplap.

Could you describe how a toplap contribution could look like. Is it just the
performance or would you do a presentation/talk first? How much time would
you need? I also could imagine including somebody from toplap in one of the
panels.

Given time and interest from your side, I will send you more detailed
information and an outline sketch of the Live-Cinema program.

I would be glad top have you participating,
hope to hear from you soon,

all the best whishes

Hi Jan,

We're real busy getting ready for a short TOPLAP tour of the UK (well,
London and Huddersfield) this weekend.  However we'd love to give both
presentation and performances at club transmediale.  It's a bit
complicated as there are many individuals and acts affiliated with
TOPLAP.  Do you have space in your programme for, say, three different
acts?  Or are you just looking for one?  In any case, we can tailor make
any size of contribution based on your needs and desires...  Note the
style of music and performance methods within TOPLAP is really diverse.

Would it be OK for us to phone you over the weekend, while there's a few
TOPLAP people together?

Take care,

alex

Good man!

Ok it seems a lot of people want to come to this, so somehow we should
make it a big toplap meeting.  We can get transmediale to pay us some
money, and I can contribute my fee for huddersfield too.

I am not sure if we can all fit into the club transmediale schedule,
although it is possible.  If not then we have some friends at a nice
space station in Berlin called c-base, we could ask them if we could
meet and perform there for an evening.
http://www.c-base.de/

Transmediale seem happy to support such sattelite events, last year we
collaborated on a dorkbot at c-base with the support of transmediale,
during their festival.

Hi all,

Just thought I'd report on a lecture I did at the London Architecture
Association (http://www.aaschool.ac.uk/) on Tuesday night, which included a
fairly hefty dose of livecoding (demoed fluxus and the live noise tools) and
the background behind them, random thoughts on electronic art in general - a
lot of circuit bending, generative art and microcontroller art.

I also took along my current project - logibloc/midi toy interface for live
logic circuit building, which despite hardly working at this point, kind of
stole the show :)

I think some of them are coming along to the event tonight too, which is cool.

cheers,

Do you mean mine for the lecture I gave?  : )

Anyway, that's fine with me- can put towards some Ryanair flights.

It's fun that a lot of people seem interested. As discussed with Fredrik 
and Alex over last days, some sort of off-transmediale TOPLAP bonus event 
might be a solution. We shall see what the organisers say about funds and 
official performance slots.

Amy and Ge, you should both move to Berlin permanently, everyone else is.

Julian, are you out there...

Kristjan, we met you at readme when you presented Auracle? Perhaps you 
could post to the list to introduce yourself and what you're doing with 
live coding.

PS Finally got the balance of improv and framework correct, so managed to 
do a proper on-the-fly constructed TOPLAP presentation at Ultrasound 
yesterday. Nice healthy audience questions too. And a manifesto compliant 
klipp av performance once Mileece had finished with her tree/dad/Bjork 
impression (don't ask). Anyway, unfortunately left Huddersfield: have to do 
a shocking covers gig tonight. Meanwhile, go Tablex!

I mailed coder at c-base, who co-organised the event there with us last
year.  Do you think it's also worth mailing Andreas Broeckmann, Amy?

Ultrasound was a lot of fun.  Klippav rocked out, with a great big
projection of live webcam cut ups and dancing abstract forms next to a
great big projection of Nick's screen.  They were big enough that we
audience members had to choose which to look at.  Personally I chose to
give more of my visual attention to Fredrik's visuals than to Nick's
text editor which perhaps shouldn't be surprising.  However I believe
that those less familiar with live coding might be more preoccupied with
the code, as a novelty.

This seems quite unexpected, that those less technically literate have
reason to be more interested in the code than those who are in a better
position to understand it.

Sadly tablex suffered a technical problem and our systems wouldn't stay
in synch, leaving Alex with a lot of work to do to hold it all
together...  Bah!  There were some nice moments, but they were mostly
rather fleeting because of the problems.  It was a shame, because I
think we were well prepared...

I'm finding lots of practice and preparation is really essential for
live coding improv.  Part of the preparation is pre-preparing scripts to
use as starting points.  However, the easiest thing to do is build up a
bulk of scripts that you then run and tweak numbers in...  But as we've
said before, that doesn't seem better than buttons and sliders.  

The key seems to be to read through all prepared scripts hours before a
performance to make sure the workings are all fresh in the mind.  Then
later it's easier to connect what you can hear with the code itself, and
look and listen for parts you might change or expand.

I didn't do this preparation when we played on thursday, but did on
Saturday, with great difference in how much I could manipulate the code.

Anyway, I could do with some sleep!

Subject: Re: [livecode] toplap at club transmediale


Jan at transmediale sent through the following info, which I'm passing on 
and throwing open to some discussion.

They want a proposal in next few days which we can prepare openly, probably 
using the wiki to help.

I enclose my questions and his responses.

Various of you have expressed interest. We are also investigating an 
off-transmediale event so that lots of people can play and no-one is missed 
out.

For our proposal, there are many possibilties- there could be an official 
TOPLAP jam as the main performance, or a live cinema thing with 
Julian/Alberto.
Talk/demoes could be Julian/Alberto, Chuck etc...

We can also hold informal talks I'm sure on the side. Seems like a good 
excuse for a big TOPLAP meeting anyhow.

There are some fees from ultrasound/state51 we hope to put towards 
expenses, we have Fredrik's flat (thanks f) etc. So even though Jan prefers 
covering 3-4 people below we can fly and accommodate more than this.

Anyway, thoughts, preferences for nature of involvement? Quotes for 
expenses?
Cheers

talk/presentation could be arround 30 minutes
panel would be about an hour [he means workshop/demo I think]
performance should be 30-40 minutes

this is the planning so far. could be that another program part will not
happen. Then we would have more time. i will know in the next two days
hopefully and will tell you then. in the meanwhile a proposal for the
outlined formats would be helpful.

Let's stick to the close members and see what we can do with them. Flights
from London, Paris or most other european cities are cheap and reasonable,
the US or other places abroad will be a problem. accomodation can be
arranged. hotel if necessary, but limited. otherwise we have some artist
flats, where we easily can accomodate people. we also server breakfast
there. So far I think of a maximum of 3-4 people.



[just to be open, Jan had noticed klipp av were involved with TOPLAP and 
thought they might be an appropriate act for the gig. This is my response]

This was probably for transmediale only, because we from club transmediale
never saw this submission. I would say, forget about this rejection. Now you
are in touch with club transmediale and we do our independent thing, even
when we cooperate with transmediale (it is complicated, I know). If we agree
on having Klipp AV, everybody (also transmediale) will support this
decision.

[there's no way I'd accept a transmediale performance for klipp av ahead of 
you guys]

I'm not certain I can make it at this point, so it would probably be better to
use the resources to get someone else who will definately make it - and I'll
sort out flights if I end up attending. Seems to be popular, so I doubt it'll
be a problem ;)

Are there any other preparations I could help with, I'm guessing we aren't
presenting anything formal, it's more discussion type events?

hi all,

just to pick up on something alex mentioned (don't have his email to quote
right now) about planning livecode performances...

I haven't ever played non-livecoding :) but I seem to plan things out in a
very broad sense, with ideas to follow during a performance - ie 

0 mins : start with percussion
     two parts, interplaying with each other
5 mins : move on to a simple melody
     copy/paste and modify versions of the same melody on different voices
     make the melody more sparse (lots of gaps and slower)
10 mins : start hitting randomise
     pick a melody and develop it in the foreground

I imagine this isn't that different to how you would broadly plan any musical
performance (well obviously you wouldn't start hitting randomise on a flute,
but you see what I mean)

I don't think I like the idea of memorising a script and just typing it out
live (I don't know if that was what you were getting at alex) I like to think
things could be a little more fluid than that...

cheers,

dave

of making a pictorial score up to half an hour before a performance.
Even though they are at times nonsensical, we do at least have something
to point at when we're agreeing upon where we are and where we're going.

Agreed - that isn't what I meant to suggest.  However through practice
an improv musician might build up a set of progressions and expressions.
But where you're playing a progression that you've played before, you'll
do it differently, in reaction to what your co-performers are doing.

When I program to an idea, and then program to it again, the two results
can look and sound very different.  For example one idea might be "tween
between a random and regular rhythm and back again."  I might practice
various ways of fulfilling that objective but would never come up with
the same thing twice, and then hopefully in a live situation would be
able to come up with something that worked well with whatever else was
going on.

Where I find I'm typing in almost exactly the same thing over and over,
then I think that should be library code.

However, after saying all that, I am coming to the conclusion that "live
coding from scratch" is an extreme position, and one I've been finding
very difficult to live up to while producing music I'm happy with.  

To start with, live coding from scratch was great, truly liberating.
But once I'd gone through all the obvious things that can be programmed
in two minutes or less, I found it quite limiting.

So right now I'm looking into developing well constructed but incomplete
starting points to improvise away from.  Here's a live recording I made
last night for example: http://yaxu.org/yaxu-20041201-test.mp3

I had an idea for a compromise between from-scratch coding and using
pre-prepared scripts, that I'm hoping to find time to research soon...
That is, while pre-preparing a script (in a livecoding environment of
course), the hacker records many 'snapshots' of the code while it's
being built.  Then when it comes to performing the code, the performer
can move backwards and forwards between these snapshots, as well as
doing live edits.  

Therefore the audience gets to hear the code grow as it was developed in
the studio, but sped up (or slowed down, or reversed).  Development time
meets performance time.

Does that make sense?

I've been taking these snapshots of my livecoding for some time now
(using RCS), but haven't got around to putting in commands to jump
between snapshots...

I guess I should add that it never seems to go to plan for me, but I've only
had 4 gigs so I can't really say anything with authority :)

yep, it's more like ideas or themes or something, I thought this was what you
were getting at, I think it's an interesting point. I think (and again, lack
of experience may prove me wrong) that to perform with a conventional computer
program, you would not have this depth of expression. Another instance where
live coding is better.

I had a guilty secret (sort of) in that I loaded up prewritten scripts in
fluxus during the aarhus gig, for similar reasons (and following a machine
lockup scenario :]). Scripts of any length have to be done this way, and are
just new starting points. In the lsystem software, I don't have to do this (at
the moment) as the code is a formal rule set for only making music, so there
are less keypresses per note(tm) required I suppose.

yeah, I saw you doing this last week, and it's Ok, cos you used grep and the
command line - if you'd used a filesystem gui browser - well, that would be a
completely different story ;)

	This is how I've been living for quite some time, with Squeak (an
environment I mentioned here a while ago). All the time is runtime
already, and the system can make perfect snapshots of itself, including
all running processes, debuggers, etc. You can even resume the snapshots
on other machines/platforms. I think it's great for livecoding.

ChucK workshop? Sounds really coool.

There is rather a clique of ChucK livecoders forming at Stacken computer 
club here in Stockholm. I'm not certain whether we'll all be able to 
afford coming to club transmediale; but in the case of lacking finances, 
maybe we could participate/listen in from Stockholm via the net?

As I say in the wiki, I'd favour a collaborative workshop, with several
informal talks, 20 mins each max plus plenty of Q&A and discussion.  I
don't think half a day is enough for a tutorial style workshop, and it
seems a shame to base it on a single toplap approach.  I think this
would fit better with transmediale, where participants might be more
interested in the nature of live coding than in learning a live
programming environment, at least while they are at the festival.

Flights from London to Berlin are cheap at the moment - about 50 pounds
including tax etc.  There's the train/bus fare costs to add on to that.

Ge and Amy's flights from the US are the biggest challenge.  Jan from
transmediale asked for people from Europe, saying US flights were too
expensive, although we should ask again.

Amy/Ge - how likely are you to be able to find alternative funding for

Quite difficult to find alternative funding - the most I can find may 
be some
partial support (which I will ask about regardless, so that $$ can go 
to other
areas/people), but it probably won't cover the bulk of the travel cost.

As for the content of our presentation, if there is only a half day for 
toplap,
then I tend to agree with Alex on there not really being enough time for
tutorial style workshops (unless there are parallel sessions?).  
However,
if I am able to attend, I would very much like to do a semi-formal 
presentation
on ChucK/Audicle (30min + questions).  It is but one toplap approach, 
but
it does give a comprehensive story of language -> method -> real-time
environment.  Of course, this is contingent on its appropriateness to 
our
final program and travel feasibility.

Best,
Ge!

Yes, lets try and chip away at it.  I'll write to transmediale (as
opposed to club transmediale) to see if they can help at all.

The workshop happens in "venue transmediale" which I take to mean the
house of world cultures.  If it's like the previous three years, then
the workshops will be held in a fairly small room, not big enough for
parallel sessions.

Sounds good to me.

Of course the best exchanges will happen outside the programme, in the
cafes, bars and restaurants ;)

The European players then claim money from transmediale for their 
flights/travel as "locals".

If Ge is coming then he should definitely do a 30 min ChucK presentation + 
perform in the TOPLAP jam, to make this worthwhile for him to suffer 
intercontinental flight...

Thanks for that Amy - does it cost much to get to the airport?

Here's the current list of people who want to attend (please add
yourself to the wiki if you're not here):

      * Nick Collins (uk) 
      * Fredik Olofsson (berlin)
      * Kristjan Varnik (berlin)
      * Julian Rohrhuber (de)
      * Alberto de Campo (de)
      * Dave Griffiths (uk)
      * Ade Ward (uk)
      * Alex McLean (uk)
      * Amy Alexander (us)
      * Ge Wang (us)

So say transmediale can cover three ukers and one de-er (they said they
could cover three to four people), that leaves one uk-er, two already in
berlin, one train fare for somewhere elsewhere in germany and two from
the US.  If we find our own accommodation, maybe they can help more
towards the transport, although we can't all fit in Fredrik's apartment!

Regardless of who club.tm end up paying for, I think it's fairest for
them to list us all as participants.

With TOPLAP funds standing at 390 pounds sterling, we're not all that
far off...  It would be nice to use some of that money for a TOPLAP
dinner, but more important is getting people there in the first place.

I'm off for a cycle ride now, but share any thoughts and I'll write to
Andreas at transmediale this evening, with a CC to the list.

I'm getting excited about this already, which is stupid, it's not for
months! :)

I think we can find a way of getting everyone there.  Yes we should get
Ge there, but we need at least one of Amy or Dave to give the visual
aspect of livecoding, both would be best for some balance but Dave isn't
sure if he can make it yet.

Yep, but I think the presentation should be part of the workshop, an
introduction to it as an in-depth case study, with shorter presentations
about the differing other systems after.  Then the talk can be about
TOPLAP as a whole.

From: alex <alex

Dear Andreas,

Hope all is well with you.  

I'm writing to tell you briefly about TOPLAP and our plans for
transmediale, and to ask your advice.

We at TOPLAP (Transnational Organisation for Promotion of Live Algorithm
Programming) have charged ourselves with the exploration and promotion
of live algorithms - that is algorithms that can be edited while they
are executing.  We project our screens during performances so that the
audience may see the sourcecode of the software that is generating the
music and/or video, as it is written and manipulated.

More information about past performances, papers, our manifesto etc can
be found at http://toplap.org/

We're very pleased to have our proposal for (club) transmediale 2005
accepted, and are piecing together a plan.  Jan Rohlf has asked us to
conduct a half day workshop, group performance and participate in a
talk/panel session.  We've also been in contact with c-base (who you
introduced Saul and I to last year), hopefully we'll be able to organise
with them a further evening of performances by TOPLAP members.

Now on to the problems.  There are ten TOPLAP members who would like to
participate in these proceedings, and it would be great for us to have
as many people there as possible, many of us haven't yet met each other
face to face.  Here we are:

* Fredik Olofsson (berlin)
* Kristjan Varnik (berlin)
* Julian Rohrhuber (de)
* Alberto de Campo (de)
* Nick Collins (uk) 
* Dave Griffiths (uk)
* Ade Ward (uk)
* Alex McLean (uk)
* Amy Alexander (us)
* Ge Wang (us)

Of course club transmediale can help with travel for some of us, but
only 3 or 4.  Also you can see that four of us are based in Germany, two
will be in Berlin.  So the big cost is with bringing Amy Alexander and
Ge Wang over.  We estimate that return flights from the US to Berlin
will be around 408 euros per person.

We have raised 700 euros in donations from TOPLAP performance and
presentation fees, but think we need another 400-500 euros on top of
that to get everyone to transmediale.

So I have two things to ask - firstly if we were to hold an event at
c-base one evening during transmediale, could that be affiliated to
transmediale as with the dorkbot last year?

Secondly, do you have ideas for how we might find the missing money for
travel expenses?  Perhaps there are still other areas in which we can
get involved with a bit more funding.  Any suggestions or help would be
much appreciated.

Take care and best wishes,

alex

http://toplap.org/?node=LivecodingGrades

I think that was the latest version?  I linked it in from the front

I should add that it was Ade's idea and mostly his work too!

dear alex,

thanks for your message. i know about toplap through the presentation 
at read_me and i like the concept - it would be great to have you get 
together in berlin in february. unfortunately, your request comes at 
a moment when we are struggling with an overdrawn budget, so that it 
is not possible that we commit to additional costs. it is very late 
now to raise additional funds, our application to the us-embassy has 
long been submitted, so nothing comes to mind right now.

if you manage to arrange something at C-Base, we'd be happy to take 
it up as a partner event; it would be good to know about this in the 
course of this week as we need to block the space in the booklet.

i'm sorry to have to be short and negative, but the situation leave 
little room for manouevre at the moment.

greetings,

-a

that depends mostly on which airport i fly out of... but i should be able

anyway, if there's only enough funds to bring one of us from u.s., i'm

i was just thinking it'd be great to see paul camacho's pixel computer as

Oops sorry!

I added to the plan a bit and put it up here:
http://toplap.org/?node=Transmediale2005

Please add your edits when you can, it has to be passed to Jan tomorrow.
I guess we can just send him that URL.

There I suggest having Ge lead the workshop, and Amy lead the panel
discussion.  Hopefully that would help them justify their trips, both
for themselves and for funding bodies.

It turns out that the toplap performance will happen in the same club
transmediale venue as before, but they are opening up another room for
it, which is like a cinema.

Goodnight!

I enclose Jan's last three e-mails of yesterday below so list members can 
see what's going on.

We need to submit something this afternoon: main points:

There is no funding from transmediale to cover Us flights, but we can cover 
Ge if the ultrasound money comes in.

I don't know where this half day workshop idea has come from (we can run 
ourselves at c-base or something but there is no official slot for that, 
see below).

panel= mix of presentations?
performance= live jam, multi projector
talk= Ge? Or Julian and Alberto?

I suspect we should perhaps invert this to do a short 30 min general talk 
showing a few systems briefly and give Ge and Julian half the panel each to 
present ChucK/jitlib. Otherwise I'm not sure how we fit everything in 
within these time constraints!

Thoughts, complaints?

Hi Nick,

actually I still don't know wether there will be an additional timeslot or
not - I hope to know by tomorrow, but it unfortunately depends on other
peoples decision, which I can't speed up myself. So let's work with what we
have for sure:
>> talk/presentation could be arround 30 minutes
>> panel would be about an hour
>> performance should be 30-40 minutes

Please send me your first proposal tomorrow - we are definitely in a
hurry...;). I am curious to read about your ideas. during the coming week,
we should shape your participationa nd confirm it, otherwise it will be a
problem with catalogue deadlines.

hope to hear from you tomorrow,

hi again,

the venue is Maria am Ostbahnhof, a huge club where we did the last club
transmediale festival also. but this time we will open up an additional
room, not used before. This room is meant more as a cinema. we will have
seats and a huge central screen. but is not a problem to split this up in
two screens or have additional screens. It is of course a question of money,
but I know that you probably will need more than one screen. How many are
needed?

Actually when inviting you, I never thought of bringing people over from the
US, which is the most expensive always. Are ten people really necessary?
where in the US do they come from? east or west coast? What amount of money
are we talking about to bring these people over? Of course you know, that we
also don't have much to spent...;)

More detailed information iwould be needed now, to develop a clear idea of
what could be done, for what amount of money and with how many people.

Hi

I just read the mail that Alex has send to Andreas. Now I understand more.
Actually we have applied for support form the british council to bring over
two toplap members from the UK (because I thought it would most likely be
Alex and Adrian). This support has been granted, so club transmediale can
take care of that. I will check if there is room in the budget for another
person from th UK, but don't know yet. I understand that it would be great
to have all that people gather together, but like Andreas I don't see a
chance for us to cover the travel costs for the US toplap members now that I
see the numbers. We did the US embassy application together with
transmediale and I also don't have any further idea where to get additional
funding that quick.

So I appologize that we won't be able to make this possible, but please
understand that at this point of the festival preparation most of the budget
is already issued. And as every year we are already over budget.

let's talk more tomorrow, when I have your draft.

Hi Jan,

Earlier you mentioned a half day TOPLAP workshop, and I understand
you're investigating whether that's possible or not...  Can I just say
that we'd be quite keen to do this if it is possible?

Also there's another point to clarify - when you say "panel," do you
mean a TOPLAP panel discussion, or do you mean participation in a panel
by a TOPLAP member?

Cheers,

alex

I disagree - we should try to cover both Ge and Amy.  We're not far off,
see money below.

The half day workshop was proposed by Jan, has become "optional," but I
think it would be great.  It would be a workshop in the main
transmediale venue, the house of world cultures.  Jan will let us know
today whether we are on for that or not, I'll let him know that we're
keen.  If they can't host it we can look into holding it in another
partner event, we have other contacts to try.

> panel= mix of presentations?
> performance= live jam, multi projector
> talk= Ge? Or Julian and Alberto?

When Jan says 'panel' he means 'participation in a panel by one TOPLAP
member' (I'll clarify this too).  However I guess we can propose turning
the talk into an introduction followed by panel discussion.

MONEY

If club transmediale cover 3 from the UK that leaves

1 x uk flight @ 75 euros
2 x internal train fares (how much would that be?)
1 x flight from west coast us (about 408 euros)
1 x flight from east coast us (about 350 euros)

We have 708 euros.

So we're not missing that much, especially with Amy and Ge are
investigating funding opportunities.  In fact we're so close that we
could choose between a UK flight and a US one.

Thanks Jan,

We're still trying to work out what's best among ourselves, it's quite
difficult to come to consensus with the time lag of mailing lists, but
some of our thoughts are here:

  http://toplap.org/?node=Transmediale2005

This might change quite a lot during the course of the day (it probably
includes more of my ideas than anyone elses), but hopefully it gives you
some ideas.

Let us know what you think, or as it's a wiki you can make your own
comments there if you wish.

Subject: AW: AW: [livecode] toplap at club transmediale
From: Jan Rohlf <jan


Hi Alex and all the others involved,

thank you for the first draft for  atoplap participation. We have made up
our minds and sorted out things a bit more:

Our proposal would be for now:

Sunday 6.2.
20:00 - 22:00
Toplap Presentation and Live-Jam at club transmediale

This would be in the so called "cinema-room" with seated audience. but no
worries, club transmediale is still a rough place and no university
audimax...:). 3 data-projectors and audio mixer will be available for this
event. I would like you to first introduce the Toplap concept and manifesto
and give an introduction in several live-coding systems and discuss them.
the idea of short drafts and examples sound good, to make people in the
audience who are not familiar with the concept and its possibilities
understand better. It would be important that the live coding jam is both
sonar and visual and that the introduction and talk also addresses themes of
interaction of sound /image, differences of sound/image for coding systems
(if there are) etc. We present toplap in the framework of a series of
performances and talks titled "Live Cinema". This program investigates into
the conceptional intersection of live generated image and sound.
Presentation and talk should be no longer than one hour. than you would have
another hour for the jam. It could be as many people involved in the jam as
you want.

Monday 7.2.
Workshop at transmediale
Haus der Kulturen der Welt

There you could do a whole day workshop, which should be divided in two
seperate parts (most likely one in the morning, one in the afternoon). These
two parts should be independent in the way that it should be possible to
attend the afternoon-workshop without having attended the morning workshop.
The workshop is for a limited amount of participants, but should address to
a wide audience and not only high skilled geeks...:) It should be an
introductionary workshop.

Carsten Stabenow from transmediale will take care of that. He will work out
the details together with you. I cc this email to him and he will get in
touch with you independently.

Another panel participation for tuesday 8.2. is thinkable. but we still work
on it and it will take a bit more time. If so I will post that seperately as
soon as we have a clear sketch on what the panel will be about. so don't
count on that.

Travel:
- club transmediale will pay travel expenses for 2 participants from UK

Accomodation:
- club transmediale can accomodate 2, maybe more participants (if necessary)
in artists flats (with daily breakfast). should be figured out in the next
weeks.

Budget:
- transmediale will pay 300.- EUR for the workshop
- club transmediale will pay 300.- EUR for presentation and jam

please let me know if this sounds good to you or what should/could be
altered. Please coordinate these dates with any off-transmediale event at
c-base. it is of course cool if that happens, but it should not interfer
with these two dates, as we are not so flexible anymore with our
program-structure. Most parts are already fixed and booked.

best whishes

This sounds really good.  Somehow I didn't anticipate the 600 euro fee,
that will be handy!  It seems fairest to put the 600 euros into the
collective travel pot.  We need to look over the finances again, but
this is starting to look good.  Please continue looking for funding
though Amy and Ge, the next job is to try to get Craig over, and pay for
a TOPLAP dinner...

How do people feel about the full day workshop?  I'm only worried about
the lack of continuity but with so many people around to show their
stuff...

Down sides that I see from a first reading...  Only two people from the
UK, but I guess that is the best offer they can make, we asked if they
could stretch it to three.  It doesn't mention festival passes - we
should ask if we can have passes for all of us.  Is there anything I've
missed?

How does this programme look?

Friday - Transmediale starts, some people arrive, go and party at club
transmediale
Saturday - Everyone else arrives, maybe a TOPLAP dinner and planning,
then more partying
Sunday - Presentation led by Amy (mini panel style) and live jam at club
transmediale
Monday - workshop at transmediale (Haus der Kulturen der Welt), perhaps
half led by Ge and the other half led by Julian?
Tuesday - possible participation in a panel session with one person from
TOPLAP, then evening performances at c-base
Wednesday - Go home

Exciting!

i'm not sure what you mean by lack of continuity? i think it roughly 
sounds good, though my first impression is it might be trying to fit too 
much into the relatively short talk/panel and then we could have possibly 
more time for the workshops than we want.

i'm not sure how the workshops would be structured: are they supposed to 
be instructional? since they're also supposed to be for a general 
audience, i'd think it would be tough to actually teach much about most of 
the apps - on the other hand, 2 half-day sessions is a bit long for just 
general discussion - though having a lot of apps and authors will 
certainly help with that.

so perhaps we should emphasize the conceptual discussion in the talk/panel 
and keep discussion of each tool very short - i.e. discussing each app in 
the context of the author's particular interest/reasaons/opinions about 
livecoding... thus hopefully whetting appetites for interested folks to 
come to the workshops. then present the tools in more depth at the 
workshops. how does that sound? one downside of that is i guess the 
workshops are limited attendance and may have to be booked in advance of 
the talk/panel.

That sounds great.  I suggest we help people install livecoding tools at
the end of the workshops too, if there is time.

This is excellent, lots more time than I was anticipating.

The main systems in the workshop could be ChucK/jitlib, half day each, 
that's an exciting lineup, and would make sense for participants 
subscribing in advance. Would that be Ok with Julian/Alberto/Ge?

It's also possible of course that the day is touted as an 'Introduction to 
Live Coding' and they also try out some other systems, but ChucK/SC would 
seem to be the most accessible systems for obtaining in advance and 
continuing with afterwards- many other things are more personal custom 
approaches, whilst these are cross platform and designed for end-users.

We also have this hour of presentation before the jam to present/discuss 
lots of systems and not necessarily have to teach them. And there is no 
reason why there can't be further small demoes as bonus material for the 
workshop. I guess Ge/Julian should make a proposal about how they'd like to 
run half day events.

It looks like we should have the funds required to get Amy and Ge across 
and grab some extra European travel, I don't see a problem with 
transmediale funding 2 Uk people, they'll indirectly fund more (I already 
said I was happy to pay for myself to come across if necessary).

The program looks exciting.

We proposed that Ge should lead the first half of the workshop.  It
would be great if Julian and Alberto do the same with the second half of
the day.  I don't think we should focus solely on these two though.

I don't think a hands-on workshop would work, there is not enough time
to learn a system and requiring that people install the system before
the workshop starts would be disruptive, especially with people coming
and going throughout.  Also remember that we need to be open to both
programmers and non-programmers, and we have up to eleven people coming
over, and it would be nice to involve them all.  If we don't, then we
could lose the chance to get everyone festival passes.

The proposed title is:
"Introducing ChucK, feedback.pl, fluxus, jitlib, noisepattern,
PureEvents, redFrik and The Thingee towards Live Algorithm Performance"

I think we should keep this proposal.

So I would say, 30-40 minute presentations by the workshop leaders,
followed by a series of 15-20 minute presentations by everyone else.
Then there can be a non-disruptive install-a-thon with a bit of
tutoring.

Hi!

	That sounds very good.

	For what it's worth, my system is currently called "musique litt=E9ral"
("literal music"). The name is meant as a companion to the venerable
term "musique concrete", and refers to the fact that I'm making music
"word for word", using natural language with an interactive-fiction
interface. It's also a pun on "literal value" in the computer-science
sense. I also considered "musique litt=E9raire" ("literary music"); I'd
appreciate any feedback people have about it. :)

	The system is also cross-platform, and installs by copying a file. (I'm
writing an explanatory website for it now, I expect to turn it on around
1 January).


	thanks again,

Subject: [livecode] workshop structure
From: alex <alex
Date: Wed, 08 Dec 2004 22:12:02 +0000



How does this look for example?

Session 1: ChucK, fluxus, PureEvents, redFrik, musique littt=E9ral
12:00 - introduction and ChucK presentation
12:45 - fluxus presentation
13:05 - PureEvents
13:25 - redFrik
13:45 - musique littt=E9ral
14:05 - installathon and hands-on workshop

Session 2: jitlib, The Thingee, noisepattern, feedback.pl
16:00 - introduction and jitlib
17:45 - The Thingee
17:05 - noisepattern
17:25 - feedback.pl
17:45 - installathon and hands-on workshop
18:05 - finish

It allows for a delayed start, for 30-40 minute keynote presentations,
and 10-15 minute presentations, with questions.  If session 1 overruns,
then one of the short presentations could move to the second session.
If one or more of us can't make it, then that's more time for the
hands-on workshop.

I tried to split similar presentations into different categories, the
rest is arbitrary...

The workshop usually has 10-15 participants.  We might outnumber them!
I've asked what the capacity is, and whether they have a bigger room.

I guess our technical requirements would be audio and two data
projectors.

Carsten at transmediale asks if we want to have a jam with the
participants on the "salon stage" after the workshop.  I'm in two minds
about this, it is an opportunity but that stage has problems.  It's in
the cafe area and is right next to stairs, so quite often there are a
lot of people looking the other way.  I suppose it would work better for
an ad-hoc jam session than it would for some of the more formal
presentations that they have there.=20

Thoughts?

Turns out my proposed workshop structure isn't suitable - the capacity
of the workshop is small without the coming and going as I suggested.
So it looks like Nick's ideas of concentrated workshops are more
sensible, apologies Nick, we should have gone for that in the first
place.

However, a good thing has come from our bold proposal, Carsten is
looking to see if we can do two hours worth of presentations in the main
conference space.  His mail is attached.  Thoughts appreciated as ever!

hm, there is no other space for the workshops. but maybe we should check if
we can modify it in direction of a presentation of all the tools and system=
s
in the conference space for a bigger audience (duration 2 h) and a
concentrated workshop with up to 3 workshop leaders and 12 people audience
afterwards.
for us it is important, that the workshops can be accessed by audience, it
would make no sense to do a more internal meeting workshop in this space.

Yeah, your proposal was a bit passive for a workshop audience- they don't 
attend to watch, it's surely more fun to get them trying stuff out 
themselves.

I like the idea of a ChucK and jitlib workshop, half day each, participants 
get explanations and to explore both. I know I'd be very happy to attend 
such a workshop. Again, Ge and Julian/Alberto, thoughts?

In terms of covering many systems, I think that's too ambitious, and some 
systems are more naturally set up for people other than the original 
creator. It's hard work to teach/install custom stuff which has probably 
only ever had one user. ChucK and jitlib have the advantage of being 
available in advance, cross platform without overly specific installation 
requirements, and have many natural help resources. They are designed for 
third party end-users.

It is good consequence that you may have pumped up the presentation time, 
so there is no fear of missing out anyone who wanted to present something.

Yes, I imagined a bigger audience, with a smaller one it makes much more
sense, especially with pre-requisite installs.  Perhaps we could
schedule an install-a-thon for the previous day?  I'd be happy to help
with any linux users.

Agreed, we should talk more about these differences sometime, an
interesting subject.

Yes, and if it doesn't come through we can host something at c-base
instead.

Thanks, I'm starting to run out of energy :), but I've been rather taken
by the idea of a large TOPLAP meeting and have run with it somewhat,

could you send me a list of participants and a very short description of the
content of the talk. it would also be good to have very short bios of all
participants + urls, if they have. or do you want to appear as an annonymous
collective..? guess not, or?
Also I would need image material 1-3 pictures of previous presentations or
performances and/or the toplap logo in print resolution. These materials
would be needed quickly. Is it possible to send it by this weekend?

actually the spave in the artist flats is limited. so no girlfriends. If

additional space soon.

What happened to the c-base side project? any date fixed yet? if so, could
you give a contact so that I could arrange a cooperation with them? My

There's a great idea, we could put some other systems on it as well.
Afterwards we could serve the CD image as a .iso from somewhere.

Good news all round by the way, we all get festival passes, and the two
hour presentation is on.

monday feb. 7th 2005
12-2pm - presentation of the different systems and tools
2-7pm  - workshop, hands on, detailed introduction to individual tools

Ge and Julian - can you prepare a very short text about your workshops
for the catalogue, maximum 200 characters for each part?  I guess you
can plan for at least 2 hours each.

Anyone mind if I introduce the presentation in collaboration with Ade,
if he's up for it?

I'm looking for a solution to the very common problem of how to
sync in an optimal way. I'll try to somehow install chrony on my 
computer, too, but I don't know what flags I have to set to configure 
it properly. Have you tried chrony on a local network? does it allow

Ok this is resolved, c-base have switched us back to the Sunday so

So please prepare to book your tickets.  

The only days you _must_ be there are now the 6th and 7th, as we're
fitting everything into two days.  I would recommend arriving before the
afternoon of the 5th so we can have a dinner together and plan the next
two days, then leaving on the 8th or later.  I might stay til the 10th

just a brief report:

I attended the live algorithms network meeting over the last two days: the 
focus wqs on autonomous AI performers for improvisation. So a complementary 
strand of research to TOPLAP, no real clash of ideology, the two are 
different in aim (though a few issues may overlap, ie demonstrating the 
intentionality of algorithms when your algorithms lack human expressions : 
) ).

The AI agent aspect was not exhibited particularly well by last night's 
concert, with some relatively typical electronic music performances (but 
some nice ones, and good to hear Jonathon Impett's emergent music system).

sure thing - my whole live music setup is now on savannah cvs:
https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/livenoisetools
and I even have a user or two now learning score code! :)

but it's probably easier to show fluxus, as the relationship between the code
and the artwork is a bit clearer - and it uses a proper script language. Let
me know what you need in terms of example scripts and documentation.

I should also have notified the list, but I did a sneaky fluxus performance
last night at the end of the Mute "Open Source Software Workshop" while Chun
Lee (http://www.sonicvariable.com/) provided music from his pd setup. I think
most people there were a bit dazed from two days of intensive pd hacking to
really get into it, bit it did spark some interesting conversation in the pub
afterward...

such as live collaberative coding over the net with some sort of source code
repository software (such as cvs) hacked for faster edits. This would make
network jamming a lot easier as you'd only have to distribute the code. Is

Oops, fingers were mis-aligned, start again.

Thanks for that Amy, but as you can see from my other mail (which got
stuck in the approve queue yesterday), It's all sorted out now.  To be
honest it's all confusing me quite a bit now but the wiki page reflects
what's happening now.  

http://toplap.org/?node=Transmediale2005

Sunday is toplap show n tell then workshops at the house of world
cultures, then performances at c-base.  Monday is mini-panel followed by
tag team live jam at club transmediale.

We'll have a toplap dinner somewhere on the Saturday.

Amy, Ge and Craig - can you get your air tickets now?

And so it is once more!

Sure, when do you need this by?

We have already sent some catalogue info to both Jan and Carsten.  Our
workings are at http://toplap.org/?node=Transmediale2005

Let us know what you need in addition to this.

Cheers,

As far as I know Ge, Craig, Amy, Nick and I definitely need space and
Julian, Fredrik and Ade definitely don't.  I haven't heard about Alberto
or Kristjan - what are your plans?

So at the moment between 5 and 7 need beds.

- two in the lounge of one of the cbase people (floorspace rather than
beds)
- two or three beds provided by club transmediale in "artist
flats" (hopefully including a single room for Amy)
- two or three staying at Fredrik's

I emailed Transmediale earlier asking them to confirm the accommodation
they're providing.

Flights - Transmediale have bought my flight and are going to refund
Nick's, so that's the two uk flights sorted.  Ade'll buy his when he has

Sure why not!  They could probably pay for us all.

I talked with Pedro a bit further.  He thinks just one act +
presentation in 'Sonarama', with up to four or five people covered with
travel, hotel and fee.  So who wants to form a supergroup?  He's keen on
Ade and I being involved at least, are you up for it Ade?  They probably
wouldn't be able to cover flights from the US, particularly for Amy as
she was there last year...

Dave, would you be available for sonar?  I think it'd be towards the end
of June.  Who else?

Ok I'll propose a slub vs nebogeo performance and a TOPLAP presentation.
I assume both will be at Sonarama, which is a bit more relaxed venue
than Sonar itself.

Tsch, it's almost as though they review a promotional video rather than
the work itself...  I suppose they have a lot of entries to get through
and this reduces entries and makes them easier to digest.

What format do they want the video in?  I remember Ade did this once
(and got a fine honorary mention) but had to make a VHS tape.  Is that
still the rule?  

I suggest we either abide by the submission rules to the letter or
completely ignore them.  If you need to make a video I could help with
turning an encoding into a tape if that's what they want.  Perhaps we
could make a 1 minute video of live coding each, and splice them all
together, with something of the live jam at the end?

Otherwise we should ignore the submission rules and you should send
whatever you like.  That might be the best option :)

I think they see it as an opportunity for the artist to represent 
themselves properly using perhaps a different medium. We should rise to 
the challenge if we're serious about submitting ourselves, but if we're 
only doing it to garner attention then we shouldn't bother.

My recommendation is that we abide by the rules, I think they will 
ignore anything that isn't on DVD or tape (unless otherwise mentioned).

Do people feel up to each making a short 1 minute film of their own 
activity? I can collect and edit into a mini-documentary if so.

Good points.

I vote yes, I think that'd be ace.  I don't know anything about video

I second this, great, also an option is to document transmediale. I know 
Fredrik has a DV-cam if that's not too forward of me to mention it on his

We can easily collate some footage then.

We have this so far: (http://www.toplap.org/?node=Transmediale2005)

For the live jam, we probably won't all fit on stage at the same time, 
although it would be fun to try. We should structure it carefully and be 
careful that it doesn't resort to pure noise (until the end). A rehearsal 
would be great.

We'll get three data projectors overlayed on one screen. Amy could bring a 
'video jockey' to switch between performers, operated by whoever isn't 
performing at that moment, to allow more people to perform than there are 
projectors.

We'll need M-F VGA cables (i.e. VGA extension cables) - one per concurrent 
performer using the video jockey. The video jockey can accomodate eight 
computers.

Alex will bring a small ten channel audio mixer, another stage mixer will 
be provided by club transmediale.


---------------

So I think we need to draw something up specific to their stressed out 
requirements. I think Amy/Fredrik you were discussing on this list already 
for projection. for audio, I assume there won't be more than five audio 
outs at once? me, Alex, Ade, Fredrik, Ge, Craig, Kristjan, Julian, 
Alberto...hmmmmm, make that ten. I think we better request six stereo ins 
to their mixer (one for Alex's mixer plus five to cover us).

anything or if anything needs revision? 

http://toplap.org/?node=TransmedialeTechPlan

in the drawing, i've put 7 performers on stage at a time - 5 on the back 
of the table and 2 on the ends. (this is of course just a stab in the dark 
- in reality it depends how big the table is.) i'd like to be on an end 
again because of the visual components to my performance. so if someone 
else is on the other end, it could balance things out and hopefully this 
helps more of us get on stage at once.

thanks amy, looks good- just one q- why do we want the projection images to 
be superimposed? Shouldn't we take advantage of multiple projectors to 
separate out the information overload? Also avoids the white screen 
domination problem if one person is brighter.

Unless you think only way to get size of text big enough is to have one 
large central viewing arena/ or the side by side juxtaposition would look 
weak.

Subject: Re: [livecode] technical riders for club transmediale 05 (fwd)


yeah, but unless ClubTM have multiple screens or an extremely large one we 
would wind up with really tiny projections if we try putting them side by 
side. if you think about the aspect ratio and how area is computed, you'll 
realize that each projection would wind up being not 1/3 the size of the 
screen, but 1/9. so we'd have a horizontal band of very small images near 
the top of the screen. and this is also assuming that clubTM would be able to 
physically mount the projectors much closer to the screen for us so we 
could get the smaller throw. 

however, we can ask clubTM if they have multiple screens - or a really big 
screen. 

other things to keep in mind... the "switched" projection will sometimes 
be in black, either during a switch or we can do it deliberately to allow 
the other screens to be clearer. there will also probably be various 
moments of "projector searching" while someone's computer crashes or 
people switch as to who's playing. all these things can be mitigated with 
superimposed images - on the other hand, with three projections, maybe we 
wouldn't care so much? 

what i think would be a good solution would be if each of the 'unswitched' 
projections could also be black sometimes. however, i only have one 
"jockey" switch. we could try to pick up some inexpensive kvm switches 
that could theoretically send a "black" signal on the unused inputs. 
however, i'm a bit reluctant - the more gadgets we have, the more things 
go wrong. do we at least have a tech check sometime before the show? if 
nobody knows, i can ask anke. 

another option - we could only use 2 projectors. this was what i think we 
wound up with at aarhus after fredrik's computer stopped transmitting. or 
perhaps we should request 3, and then perhaps decide later to only use 2. 

thoughts?

i do like blending also, at least most of the time. emphasizes 
the dynamics of coding as the screen is almost always "moving" even 
when one person's screen isn't changing much. and creates interesting 
visual rhythms between the various screens' movements.

i'm thinking having 2 superimposed much of the time might be a bit clearer 
than 3 though. but we could definitely turn at least the switched 
projection to black easily - just not sure how it will work with the other 
2.

blending's cool - as long as everyone's backgrounds are black - otherwise you
get the "pd effect" blowing everything else away :)

it does have a certain appeal having multiple cursors and mousepointers
happily coexisting in the same screen space...

btw, apparently this month's "Linux User and Developer" has an article about
toplap and some pics from the runme festival in it.

Subject: [livecode] more on video switches


i picked up a KVM switch over the weekend to test out with projector. 
(hope to return if we don't need.) 
unfortunately as i suspected, it's not possible to leave a port vacant to 
use as "black" (no sync so the projector starts searching for input). on 
the other hand, a computer hooked up to it with a blank screensaver works 
reasonably well as a "black" signal. so, if we want to, we could:

a) have several people hooked up on projector A to the "real" switch as 
planned
b) have 2 people on one of the other blended projectors (call it 
"B") alternate playing. 
whoever is not playing would leave their computer there running a blank 
screensaver, but set not to go into standby.
c) when we want to eliminate chaos, switch the display on projector B to 
the "blank" computer. performer on projector B can continue playing audio, 
but their screen won't be seen.
d) in order to balance things out, we can also black out projector "A" 
sometimes (the switch there has a black position on it automatically.)

the KVM switch i picked up also unfortunately requires a ps/2 keyboard - 
has no manual switch. i wouldn't like to haul another keyboard with me 
(i'm bringing one or 2 of my usb portables already), though somewhere at 
home i have a flexible rubber keyboard i might be able to bring if i can 
find it. though if there's a ps/2 keyboard someone can bring from berlin, 
that'd be nice.

or: if this all seems too complicated, we could just forget about it and 
have all images supered. i'm just a bit concerned because 2 images for the 
whole show wouldn't be too bad, but 3 the whole time could look a bit 
chaotic.

thoughts?

as it stands, we're doing just individual sets at c-base, and just a group 
jam + various speaking events at club transmediale and transmediale. 

you can find the itinerary thus far at the top of:
http://toplap.org/?node=Transmediale2005

now that most times are set, i did some editing so it can be followed a 
bit more like a schedule.

maybe early on monday, before the soundcheck (which we have to arrive at 
3:30 for...) ? probably should be not too 
early though, as we might be recovering from the gig at c-base the night 
before.

Subject: [livecode] EMF promo


Hi all,
       Joel Chadabe contacted me yesterday about adding TOPLAP events to 
his worldwide laptop festival. I said we were doing transmediale and sonar 
in the coming months, below. Originally he was going to contact people last 
September, hence my slight reluctance to commit to do anything for him at 
this late stage. transmediale falls outside the official start date of 10 
feb for his festival.
   Might be worth some promotion (though surely won't get us any more 
audience for this weekend!) but I'm a bit suspicious because there are no 
funds and we do all the work; EMF just claim our event as part of their 
festival.
   What do people think, want to stay independent?

cheers
N


Hi Nick,

All is not lost. TOPLAP is so interesting that I think we should include it 
as a curtain-raiser, so to speak, or at least we can assign it that role so 
that it's a part of the documentation. If you'd like to do that, please do 
send pictures, program copy, notes, whatever you think would make clear 
what you've done to a public reading about this into the future.

If you can send some information now, I'll put it in our calendar ... 
valuable because we can then include it in an email going out before the 
weekend. For the info we need, have a look at ...

http://www.arts-electric.org/aboutus/listing.html

and send the info directly to me.

Best,

Joel

heyy all--

     Wow, that was fantastic and a great deal of spa! :)  Thanks to you
all; it was wonderful to meet and play with you all and I'm eager to do
it again.

     The HKW money is here in my hot little hands, thanks to Alex, Amy,
and Ge; thanks again.

     I've got a fair amount of video as well: both panels, shows
(including a fun full-rotation sweep during the CTM show), and some
"behind the scenes footage" of setting up, etc. Sometime when I'm not
busy touring castles I'll get to uploading it. ;)

     'Sorry I missed CTM on Tuesday, Fredrik... I meant to take a brief
pre-show lie-down and the next thing I knew it was morning. :)  Le
Placard has been fun, though, looking forward to more at CTM before I
leave on Sunday.

     Calls and SMSs appreciated, this new phone is really bringing out

Alright rockstars and artstars,

The festival was a blast. It was great fun to meet with you all, and 
hear the crazy ideas
and music being conjured up. It was nothing like I expected, but somehow 
it worked
out well it its own way. Livecoding found its way into different 
environements: a panel discussion,
workshop, and the two different clubs. I hope it continues to grow rapidly.

were there shouts of joy at the performer's keyboard skillz, or boos of

unfortunately, I think my webmail server is probably wrong. it's not as bad as
my laptop - which constantly seems to be several days late, whatever I do to
it. this is a nagging worry regarding any future ntp synced jams - I may have

	The former (with happy option). Of course, "woo woo of war" is quite a 
catchy name and should not be dismissed lightly.

	All seriousness aside, I think livecoding is like totally bitchin' and 
I intend to keep at it. I'm up for any rebandment.

I thought it might be useful to offer some brief feedback from my 
fiancee, who was sitting in the audience, and has no knowledge of 
programming and observed the performance from a musical and conceptual 
perspective. I'm also including my thoughts on these points in order to 
offer some sort of useful critique. It should also be noted that my 
fiancee does not hesitate to let her opinions known, even when critical 
- so I'm certain these aren't very biased. :-) However, do remember 
these are purely her and my opinions and may not reflect the entire 
audience's feelings.

She felt the discussion and exploration of livecoding was fascinating 
and worthwhile, and had no problems understanding what was happening 
(although not necessarily on a 'this code does that' level). Encouraged 
through our remarks that we'd be listening to each other however, she 
felt this was clearly not happening during the performance - and with a 
bit of hindsight I somewhat grudgingly agree with her. She mentioned 
other people in the audience discussed this too. There was tremendous 
concentration and some of us were very good at working together, but at 
times the music suffered from the tendency of an individual to become 
too introverted with their own work, and as such the entire performance 
didn't gel together too well. In response, I'd add that given this was 
our first performance together, perhaps this isn't a surprise - but the 
matter of collaborating on a piece of music is a different matter to 
getting a piece of software working nicely, and maybe some of us (me 
included) need to work harder on this.

Another major point of concern was that of the visuals. From her 
remarks, I get the feeling that anything that might be considered 
obfuscatory detracted from the performance. Whilst she appreciated 
seeing lots of people's work throughout the performance, and enjoyed 
the variety and diversity of techniques, there was a tendency for some 
people's visuals to be lost in the chaos of others. This is a very 
tricky issue since everybody is using different systems and we knew 
this might happen. I don't think she's referring necessarily to the 
"white-on-black vs. black-on-white" issue here, but more to the actual 
content and animations. Perhaps some separation between specific visual 
treatments is needed, in order to highlight specific things happening, 
and allowing those with very dynamic visuals to showcase their work.

This segues into the final point, which was of musical separation and 
themeing. A large jam like this is naturally chaotic but there should 
be individuals who, at times, take the lead and run with a theme that 
influences the other players - a bit like a jazz improv-soloist. We 
didn't have anything like this and as a result I think our performance 
was a little stale given it was approaching two hours long. I had an 
idea that we could have a conductor, who allows individuals to run with 
a theme alongside the other players for a little bit, can control the 
visuals, and generates a narrative that the audience can follow. This 
doesn't mean that a large all-hands-on jam can't happen, but that an 
audience that concentrates for such a long time requires some diversity 
in style and approach that is hard to achieve when most people are 
playing at once. Our audience was remarkably patient and from what I 
understand, we tested that patience a little.

On the positive side (phew!), the little details seemed to make a bit 
difference. Writing instructions to the audience to get them to 
participate was a good move and very enjoyable apparently, and 
conceptually the ideas explored were surprisingly accessible and well 
received. We demonstrated a great cross-section of possibilities and I 
think more than justified the practice of livecoding to an uninitiated 
audience.

Hope this is constructive in some way. Fun fun!

	Yeah, I agree. It was an exquisitely frustrating experience in that 
regard for me... I wished very much at the time that we were doing a 
multi-night gig, with opportunities to discuss how things went on a

I guess the encouraging thing is that these problems are not faced through
anything *particually* to do with live coding itself, but more basic problems
with communicating during a performance. 

Some sort of enforced structure would be very helpful in these situations I think.

Perhaps roles should be assigned (drummer/bass/lead type of thing)

A really pure livecode jam would be to work on one piece of code, like a
highly compressed software project using a live type of concurrent source
control. Then we'd be forced to read/listen to what everyone is doing. We'd
all be working on one thing, not splitting off in multiple directions (maybe)...

Subject: Re: [livecode] re: happy codeday


one simple thing that can help on the visuals side would be just adopting 
the "variation in proportions" graphic design principle - assuming this 
can be done without interfering with the actual coding. that is, different 
people using different size fonts (and possibly shells.)   this 
would a) vary the proportions of the coding images, 
and b) amplify the kinetics of typing (because movement would be bigger 
too.) of course, it would be difficult to code with everything at 72point 
font, so something would need to be worked out - maybe on a shell by shell 
basis. 

one thing that made things this time look a bit static and and the same 
time visually chaotic was that we had a lot of screens this time 
(supercollider?) which were mostly/entirely small text in one big shell, 
with seemingly little movement. and then when we switched between them, it 
wasn't always readily apparent we had switched.  this was easier in aarhus 
where the coding environments seemed more visually varied and kinetic. for 
example, the PD interface there, though it blew everything out with its 
whiteness, was quite kinetic. 

of course, the best thing would be a rehearsal - coordinating visuals of 
10 people without a rehearsal is a crapshoot at best... but obviously this 
is a problem of having a) time and b) projectors, or at the very least 
monitors so you can try to imagine what the superimposition would look 
like. 

other things that would help would be more flexible switching hardware (a 
second presentation jockey, for example), but those cost some money.  and 
possibly just sticking with 2 projectors superimposed all the time. for 
next go round, among other things, i'm going to add a "blackout" key to the 
thingee so it can just make its projector cut to black sometimes... that 
could serve a similar purpose. 

anyway, we should realize this is a right strange undertaking both 
auditorally and visually, and any time you "invent the wheel" with a novel 
kind of performance project (or most anything else)  it always takes some 
tries to get it "right".... so hopefully we can have another 
big toplap/poplap/stopgap jam soon so we can keep practicing! ;-)

Date: Tue, 22 Feb 2005 16:51:58 +0000



Hello TOPLAPpers,

I'm collecting small bits of footage for the Ars Electronica DVD 
submission (or more generally for a mini documentary) that I'll edit. 
I've got a lot of video footage from Fredrik (thanks!) of our 
Transmediale event, but I'd like to get some audio snippets of as many 
of you as possible talking, a bit like a one-on-one interview, although 
obviously conducted remotely, via the Internet, in non-realtime. You 
could imagine me sitting in-front of you asking these questions if you 
think it helps, although I can't imagine that'd be the case. Don't let 
it disturb you too much.

So just set your microphones recording (doesn't need to be very high 
quality, but at least 16 bit @ 22kHz please) and answer these 
questions:

0. Please tell me your personal interpretation of the T.O.P.L.A.P. 
acronym.
1. Who are you, and what the hell do you think you're doing?
2. So why don't you just go and play a regular musical instrument?
3. So you're saying that musicians are going to be replaced by robots 
eh? (imagine I'm the narrow minded tabloid journalist for this one)
4. Why is live coding compelling?
5. What is the next live coding thing you're going to do?

I'm only looking for a few minutes of dialogue maximum. Once done, 
compress as an MP3/OGG/etc and upload it via 
http://www.signwave.co.uk/go/clients/upload - or onto your own servers 
and mail me a link.

I'm hoping to start building the video this week and the deadline for 
Ars Electronica is getting close.

Mail me if there's any questions. The more input the better!

Cheers,

and it was great fun to get together with you all.

but i still think we should've ended it nice and clean while at our

I pretty much agree with this view. Actually, I found it quite 
comical how we were sitting there on stage more or less involved in 
this slightly boring activity. If we had done it outside for the 
chill out zone, nobody would have complained I guess - the theatre 
setting gave the whole thing a certain dadaesque atmosphere. I did 
enjoy the mellow mix of different attempts, incuding nick writing his 
ugen ..
But I guess all of us can do much better than this.

Subject: [livecode] livecode text piece


Hi livecode massive,
                    I was getting fed up that no-one had found a livecode 
precedent amongst the 60s/70s textmusik scene, so I have 'discovered' one 
by underground Swedlish composer Click Nilson, enclosed below, originally 
written in 1975 I understand.

I encourage your own discoveries- perhaps there are some that precede this? 
If we can find a few more, I'll set up a wiki page to hold them.

An Instructional Game for 1 to many musicians

Each performer maintains one or more lists of instructions: they begin with 
just the one below. Each minute, as reckoned by their poor sense of human 
long-term timing, they must follow one instruction per list in their 
possession.

1. (CHANGE) You may add a new instruction to your list or modify an 
existing one.
2. (DELETE) You may delete one instruction from your list.
3. (EXCHANGE) Exchange one instruction list with another player of your 
choice; they must defer but may choose which set to exchange with you if 
they have more than one.
4. (PROLIFERATE DUTIES) You may make a copy of an existing instruction set 
and henceforth proceed with this set too at the next calculation stage.
5. (SONIFICATION). During the next minute using your instrument or voice 
you may play the musical phrases embodied by instructions on one list in 
your possession. You will utilise timing, pitch and timbre as best you can 
to convey the spoken form of the instructions.
6. (TERMINATION). If you have four instruction sets or have exchanged four 
or more times you may finish playing the game.

Notes- modern versions of this game may find a photocopier or computer 
assistance helpful for  copying and exchanging. It has also been found 
propitious to utilise projection of instruction sets to enable an audience 
to see the state of play- alternatively, the audience may  wander amongst 
the performers and act as observers and arbiters of disputes.

Computer modeling of the game itself has been successfully demonstrated by 
some advanced performance groups.

Performers may wish to set a practical time limit too- rumour has it that 
Nilson is still playing after losing instructions 1 and 6.

this is very nice. I think in the whole era of formalism and 
Konzeptkunst there must be a broad range of these kind of algorithms. 
I'll show this to Kurd Alsleben today, he's been in the (mostly 
visual) algorithmic art scene for 30 years or so. Maybe he knows some 
more.

Hello again,

Thanks to those who have sent in some audio files for the Ars 
Electronica DVD, they will make the submission very entertaining. If 
there's anyone else who can or intends to send some dialogue in (even 
if it doesn't follow the questions I've asked; I'm happy to accept any 
spoken dialogue) then today is probably the last chance. I have to get 
this DVD created today or tomorrow since it has to be in Linz for 
Friday.

MP3s/OGGs/etc can be uploaded to 
http://www.signwave.co.uk/go/clients/upload

Thanks,

Hello all,

So I think I've finished the short video (6 mins) for the DVD to submit 
to Ars Electronica. Thank you to everybody that sent stuff, I didn't 
use a lot of it - even though you all put so much effort in - but I 
hope it still works okay. I tried to include everybody even if for a 
brief moment. It features snippets of performances, overlaid with 
extracts of dialogue explaining what TOPLAP is. The quality isn't 
brilliant but it should be good enough. At least it introduces us as a 
group in a very basic manner.

Here's a low-res MPEG-4 version of the documentary:

http://www.signwave.co.uk/clients/toplap/DVD-MPEG4-Preview.mp4

I sincerely hope I haven't made any mistakes/left anyone 
out/misattributed content/grossly offended anyone. If so, I do 
apologise in advance, this has all been thrown together at the very 
last minute.

I'm going to burn a DVD now and put it in an envelope. I think I also 
need to fill in some forms before I post it to Linz. Does anyone 
already have anything planned with regards to this?

Cheers all,

Well, I have submitted TOPLAP to the 2005 Prix Ars Electronica. I'll 
let you know when we win.

I had to add a selection of people's biographies before I was allowed 
to submit it, and since time is tight I only could be bothered to fill 
in the web site a few times - please don't be offended if you're one of 
the people I didn't include, you should all sleep safe in the knowledge 
that I utterly fabricated the biographical details of the people I did 
submit. If (when?) Ars Electronica want to speak to Click Nilson, or 
get in touch to verify Amy's thoroughly fictionalised date of birth, we 
can be sure to get all the details correct. Or maybe not. The 
possibilities are endless.

Also, some people seemed to be suffering at my web server's mangled 
mime types with regards that MPEG4 preview, so if you've got it 
installed, here's a QuickTime movie of the same documentary which might 
work better.

http://www.signwave.co.uk/clients/toplap/DVD-QuickTime-Preview.mov

I can also upload a huge full-res version if people want? Some people 
have asked for a DVD but I'd much prefer uploading a big QuickTime to 
burning everyone copies and paying for postage. Let me know what works 
best for you, those that would like a copy.

Yo guys,

Just thought i'd raise my sleepy new baby tiredness head above the duvet for 
a second..
Thought some of you might like to know that im still working on my 
live-coding performance/programming tool.
Its now got a full script editor,with tooltips (for function parameter 
hints), help files, syntax coloring and clever parsing stuff.
I also managed to write vst hosting into the app (all scriptable and dynamic 
from the user written code)
and channel management. Also a sample managemet library accessible from code 
level or gui.
sadly i havent got as far as making a ditributable version and i need to 
workon making a load of demo patches.

Im interested in how any of you use realtime synthesis from code level.
My app uses sample file playback functions  but i might start a synthesis 
library
not used any command line synth stuff so wonder if you have got any 
pointers?
(for things like creation and modification etc) obviously a synthesis 
library could get very complex
id rather not get too deep into it but wonder if a simple library would be 
worth adding.

Tom

I think everyone has to pay 150 euros, and everyone is considered a
"volunteer", it's a group effort.  I'd really like to go, in fact I
bought my entrance ticket, but have now discovered that it clashes with
a family holiday so unfortunately won't be able to make it.

Friday 25th March 2005
London, England
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - WITH APOLOGIES FOR CROSS-POSTING


Signwave now accepting beta testers for new generative audio software 
used at 2005 World Expo.


Signwave UK, makers of generative software artworks such as Autoshop 
and Auto-Illustrator, are now accepting applicants to join the beta 
testing phase for their latest generative audio software, Pure Events, 
which will be pre-released in the first half of 2005 for Mac OS X 10.3 
or higher.

By combining radical practices such as DSP programming, module 
tracking, spreadsheet calculations and livecoding, Pure Events makes it 
possible to create generative music and audio systems that change in 
exciting and dynamic ways at runtime. This "never-the-same-twice" 
technique, ideal for realtime ambient soundtracks as well as live 
musical performances, has garnered considerable attention in the arts 
and media industries recently. In 2001, Signwave won the Transmediale 
Artistic Software award for their generative vector graphics 
application, Auto-Illustrator. Now they turn their attention to music 
and audio production, and plan to encourage diverse exploration and 
creation of audio systems via this exciting new piece of software.

Signwave Pure Events is currently powering the ambient soundtrack in 
the UK Pavilion at the 2005 World Expo in Aichi, Japan. Accompanying 
the interactive exhibits on site, Pure Events composites fragments of 
both synthetic and sampled sounds, and is responsible for generating a 
surround-sound atmosphere to complement the theme of this year's Expo: 
nature.

Individuals interested in joining the beta testing program for Pure 
Events can enrol at http://www.pure-events.com/

For more information on Signwave, their products and services, or to 
contact them, please visit http://www.signwave.co.uk/

yup! I've been playing with live genetic programming ideas.
my live music system:
http://www.pawfal.org/Software/livenoisetools/images/lnt.png
uses genetic programming and livecoding interchangably, allowing you to hack
evolved lsystem rules, or evolve hand written rules - used to create musical
scores.

the genetic interface (the breeder) lets you audition four mutated variations,
and pick one for further mutation.

this isn't really classical GP though, I'm also developing this:
http://www.pawfal.org/index.php?page=WigWamJam
for evolving synth patches, which uses standard Koza style GP.

As you can see - I've avoided fitness functions, as they are really bloody
tricky, and means the GP enters the realms of generative art. 

I really prefer manual selection for this application, it appeals more to my
sense of serendipity, and trying to figure out fitness functions to to make
different types of music seems too much of a boring academic exercise for a
hacker like me :)

So, genetic programming is about generating code by using biologically
influenced methods of selection and competition. You make a population of
programs, either randomly created, or from a single ancestor, run them all,
select the best one (or a top percentage) - and create a new population by
mutating these programs, or merging them to make new ones using crossover
(also known as sex). After many iterations, you should approach an ideal
you're looking for.

In a simple system like my GP synth, the selection is manual - I'm stepping
though the "semi infinite space of possible noises" manually, and according to
my own whimsy. The populations are only ever 4 big.

The job of a fitness function would be to make this process automatic. It
marks the results of a generated piece of code. This means you can have much
bigger populations, as you don't have to mark them yourself - and you can tune
the selection mechanisms to achieve optimal results. 

If a fitness function for scoring music was programmed to score fast melodies
highly, the selected individuals would favor speed, and the population as a
whole would be slowly filled with programs that create faster melodies. If you
could change the fitness function on the fly, your population would react to
the changing pressures and adapt further to gain high marks.  

Obviously, the overhead to all this is quite heavy, but ignoring that...

The more interesting problem is how you describe the the music (or whatever)
in qualitative terms that can be used to grade results. If you could devise a
language that would be suitable to this you could hack it live to guide the
evolution. I think of the text adventure game creating language as a possible
model - "make me a tune with 3 notes" ... "add an off beat snare drum, panning
from left to right" ... etc

This may be somewhat like strapping a livecoding interface on to a generative
process, but it may be possible to rapidly program complex applications this way. 

There is a lot more on this technique here:
http://www.genetic-programming.org/

ok. on-list!

As I was talking to dave, I'm thinking about the
subject of my master thesis(I'm just begining so I
very very excited about it). At the University of S=E3o
Paulo.
And then I had the ideia of putting genetic
programming and live programmed music together. I sent
a message to this list and dave replied me...=20

usualy in GP the programms are displayed in their
parse-tree form. A cross-over happens when branches
are axchanged between direrent (or not) parse trees.

There is "size" problem yep... How could I show
several parse trees (of the running programms) in a
friendly user(audience and programmer) interface?
I thought about a tree of trees or a list of trees...
???

There is this() paper where the guy talks about
something like what we are thinking of but not live.
The user has to wait until one music ends, rate it,
and then move to another.
http://graphics.stanford.edu/~bjohanso/gp-music/
He realized that this was slow and boring and tried to
use a trained neural network to do the fitness
function. I'm not sure that this is nice becouse it's
like shooting your own foot.. Using a meta-heuristic
to give data to another...

I thought initialy an easy way to construct the
fitnnes function would be:
Each programm would have a probability of survival. At
the end of a turn a random mechanism would decide if a
programm would survive to reproduce or die according
to the probability..
If the programmer does not set a probability of
survival to a programm then we can do lots of things
like it inherits an average of its parents
probabilities...

Usualy the fitness function is refered as an important
part of the "enviroment" where the indiviuals are
living. We could say that in a "live coding gp system"

(lcgps(hehehe)) the enviroment would be the
music-programmer! He can edit a given proggram, he can

Generally speaking, I think combining interactive programming with 
genetic programming is interesting because of a certain 
incongruousness they seem to have. GP really comes from the tradition 
of problem-solving automata, interactive programming more from the 
side of expressing problems. If a gp algorithm has found a 'good' 
solution, it might not express a problem clearly, it is still a good 
solution (and maybe a better one than one could have found by 
thinking about it). A question to you who have a certain experience 
with this 'breeding' practise: can you still follow the (textual) 
output of your algorithms - I mean do they "make sense"? (Of course 
in live ecoding it does not matter so much that we, as a programmer, 
watch the program program, and, just like the audience, don't 
understand what's going on)

Another side of this is that the terminology of genetics (and 
immunology) is full of metaphors with a very political taste, usually 
neo-liberal: competition, survival, defence etc. This terminology 
also naturalizes certain behaviours - like hereditary descendence - 
which should nearly automatically be challenged by a process of live 
coding. How does literature and nature metaphors "interbreed"?

Writing programs on the fly, I got the impression that the relation 
between statistical and deteministic properties of the algorithm gets 
quite relevant. If there is too much randomness, modifying the 
program does not yield any new insight in the process. But this is 
the case for a certain durational range - very fast changes are 
overlooked easily enough. I would guess that gp + ip is really good 
for these ranges.



What do you think?

Exactly, again you return to the issues faced by anyone using generative 
processes in  live context.
It can become a struggle between signal and noise (or rather the users 
signal and the computers evolving signal). Of course it becomes more about 
what controls and limitations you put in place to begin with.
As the designer of the basic performance environment you can set yourself up 
for an edgey battle, where the
GP aspects can modify high profile elements of the performance, global 
tempo, global key etc. Or you
can limit them to evolving lower profile themes such as subtle fx processing 
or note masking etc.
However if setup properly having GP strands could allow the performer to 
demote some experminetation/development to the computer and increase their 
supernatural multitasking skills!

Not really - no. They can contain large amounts of code that does not get
executed, or is irrelevant. This can be minimised by scoring code length, but
it's generally there to some extent. This can be seen as being "junk dna" and
may be important to have around - but more on the dodgy biological parallels
below. They can also employ ways of doing things that are truely arcane and
hard to follow.

The use of biological language in these cases is more than little misleading,
as I am constantly reminded by my geneticist girlfriend. There is really no
parallel between the methods of GP, genetic algorithms or any of these
techniques and real life genetics. They take a certain aspect of adaption and
steal a lot of the terminology for processes that we really understand little
about yet even in current biology.

It would be great to be able to seperate this language between the biology,
computer science and social politics, as they really share very little
meaning. It's really important to get this message through to people, I think.

I'm not sure I follow you, but it would be possible, if only viewing the best
code for the latest poplation, to watch the development, and improvement in a
way that would be almost understandable I think - maybe not in specifics, but
in a general sense.

The thing that GP and livecoding share in opposition to the traditional act of
writing software, is that they are more concerned with the program being part
of a dynamic process. Nothing is ever finished.

Coming back to what I first blurted out, I have to admit that there is
something about the pure GP approach with fitness functions and so on, that
doesn't sit well for me. 

I think the ability to be able to write some code, then have variations of it
generated to choose from is really powerful though, and doesn't remove you
from the basic process. You can edit the code if you want, and the decisions
aren't made for you.

I do think it would be fun (and marginally possible) to set up a GP system to
evolve from the classical "device driver" level, to a complex musical piece
though! :)

cheers,

dave

This is what I call manual selection, as opposed to automatic selection by
fitness function.

I see that this is a quite unique thing: a programmer will normally 
try to get rid of this type of idle-code as fast as possible. But for 
live coding as well as for gp it makes a big difference how much one 
has to do to activate it again - the difference might be one 
character. Similarly, sometimes it's not good to optimize code (too 
early, but in our case, maybe ever) because certain ways of changing 
it only come up due to its present form. On the other hand, 
obfuscated code is hard to "think in", so it also makes certain steps 
impossible.

I can't agree more. Maybe it is this language to a certain degree 
that allows people to think in such ways (Maybe good that it is so 
obvious). But generally it is also important to keep apart a broad 
statistical way of thinking (selection pressure etc.) from a more 
individual event structure, like a new idea or simply something that 
happens.

Yes, what I meant is that, say if you consider pink noise, you cannot 
immediately understand what is going on. But because it happens so 
fast, it does not take long to pick out the typical characteristic of 
this noise. Playing back pink noise at, say, a sample a minute, it 
would be nearly impossible to reason about. The selection rules (be 
it the ones you use when selection manually or the automatic 
selection rules) act as part of the audible synthesis process. So it 
would be interesting under what conditions one finds it possible to 
reason about their logic.

That is funny to see that this could also be said of the computer as bein=
g
a fundamental part of the artifact (or a performance) as opposed to merel=
y
being used to create art. This is highly interesting when trying to
establish a relationship between art and technology, is not it ?

Whould you say that this changes what is considered to be the medium 
of the art?
What is left as a carrier (or, more mathematical maybe, as an 
invariant)? What role would you give the computer or the algorithm 
there - is ist like an externalized thinking world?

That is what is interesting! what is the role of technology in Art ?
Should we divide them in two different field ? Have they not been only on=

in the past ?
Another way to look at it is to say that Art is a language that human
beings use -as Technology- to express emotions. When I say "as Technology=
"
is to consider Technology as another species along with Human Being using
Art to espress itself; DeLanda puts it like this:

interesting is not it ?

what would be the difference, in your opinion, between a computer and

This is a question I cannot answer, better ask a robot for this :+)

Seriously, let us consider the idea for a sec, that WE are not expressing
ourself but Technology (as a separate species) is and we are only helping
this to happen.

I think the notion of expression needs to be revisited. I don't find 
it extremely hard to consider what you suggest, but my question was 
more, what makes you consider it? Is there specifics of a computer 
that makes them different (in this regard) to other stuff, like 
chairs, who make us sit on them, and want to travel around with us in 
the world in our cars?

Eek, I'm lost! If you're using an evolutionary strategy, like GP - the
computer *is* merely being used to create art, it's role in the creative
process is just as constrained as any other system - the application of some
random numbers does not make it magic.

Sounds like anthropomorphism to me, but then I never have been able to get a
grip on the (computer != paintbrush >= artist < medium) type of arguments! :)

Constraints (also our own constraints) make us not less creative, but 
possibly more. Something that is "merely being used to create art": 
This "merely" would then mean that art is artist-intentionality (the 
intention to create art) mediated by the computer?

I don't get them either, but I'm interested in what makes us 
attribute anthropomorphisms to things.

absolutely! I observe this every day - ie: trying to write software that
pretends that it has no limits is deadly, for artistic users particually, as
they are clever enough to see that this is a flawed concept, and are forced to
bang their heads against brick walls, but I digress...

yup, but there is nothing unusual about that, its the same way a cymbal
mediates the kind of sound you can make with it. the interesting stuff comes

The basic  idea is to have  a venue where researchers  and composers can
discuss  preliminary  or visionary  ideas.  The  ideas  can be  musical,

developed systems are  required, the only restriction is  that the ideas
should be original, inspired and thought provoking.

The proposals will be reviewed by a panel. The authors will have a 5 min
presentation time in a  free-spirited discussion forum inside the ICMC05
activities. The  accepted proposals will  be printed as  handouts during
the venue. After the conference, a book will be published containing the
papers and a summary of the discussion. This book will also be available
online through the S2S=B2 website.

We are personally  inviting relevant figures in the  field to contribute
to this  idea, which  we think  is exciting and  promising. There  is no
specific format  or template  for this call,  we encourage  original and

Not sure on this one, but I've been slowly writing a simple virtual
machine that's designed for livecoding - I think, a bit like chuck, but i=
t
runs an unbreakable microcode, there are no combinations of instructions
that can cause an error - so you can give it random text (been testing
with emails) and it will assemble and run without complaint.

This way you can treat code in a more freestyle manner. I'm looking for
(probably going to end up writing) an editor client where you get a lot o=
f
debugger style feedback, of program flow, memory status, and can
copy/paste code around more like a painting application.

All i/o is through OSC (a single asm instruction to send the stack as a
message).

I'm not really sure where it's heading, but I'm hoping it's going to be a
way for me to livecode fluxus and noisepattern at the same time.

It also allows self modifying code, and direct access to heap memory from
/peek and /poke osc messages, so it's possible to write code that writes
code etc etc. I haven't entirely got my head round that yet though.

cheers,

dave

Subject: Re: [livecode] ICMC Inspirational Ideas - code agents


interesting idea
just some thoughts about this

I guess with this like the EMI the code is serving (in
one perspective) to define musical patterns/structures
there might exists comman code signatures that are
often coding in order to bring about these authors
musical signature.. 

Is it the case that you tend to repeat previous code
(a coding style), perhaps with variation, in order to
create musical changes (musical style)

Perhaps by tying in analysis of the musical structure
as it unfolds in time to how you change your code, the
agent can base its idea of how you are going to code
by how you intend the music to go. So it will need a
theory of your musical changes and theories of your
musical structures before it can get a theory insight
into your code that brings about this music. EMI does
not generate theories of composition, only theories of
music, perhaps live coding offer a way to combine both
a theory of music and some kind of theory of
composition (coding) - even though it cannot look a
want goes inside your mind. By if coding is the
expression of your musical thoughts perhaps it does!

So it examine a body database of previous recording of
your livecoded music and database of how the code got
formed and changed to bring about this music.

cheers Paul,

well, to keep ramping this up, run an auditory model simulation informing a 
higher level musical model with both topdown and bottomup information 
passing with appropriate neural connections to motor cortex simulations etc

So not only do we have to solve hard outstanding problems in computer 
science but also in CASA/neuroscience. So they couldn't possibly say we 
weren't coming up with unimplemented ideas...

But yes, your comments are nice, it's fun to match the audio output at 
given moments to the most recent code that probably gave rise to it...each 
significant new recompile could tag the next audio section and you'd have a 
combined database of text and audio data. So in this quick hack way, with 
some simpler DSP feature detection, might be doable as a prototype. Arm 
wave our way through what gave rise to what and deeper meanings of 
programs...

May as well include visuals in this too while we're at it...store 
screenshots of text, camera eye view of venue etc..

Then let the agents scurry through the database working with and against 
you for live coding esotericism of the like which audiences can be even

I've been thinking about this recently actually, having been playing
with some auditory models for college, like this one:
http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/cnbh/web2002/bodyframes/AIM.htm

I think implementing the whole mammalian auditory cortical-sensorimotor
loop might be a little beyond us at the moment. But perhaps we could
think about the auditory periphery.

Andy Wuensche's cellular automata software (www.ddlab.com) finds CA
rulesets with "interesting" patterns like gliders automatically, by
looking for patterns with high variance in the entropy of lookups to the
transition table. Not too random, not too static, but "just right",
goldilocks style. 
> ftp://ftp.cogs.susx.ac.uk/pub/users/andywu/papers/cplex.pdf

Perhaps a system could be designed or evolved that maximizes the input
entropy variance of the signals in the auditory nerve, as predicted by a
model like Patterson's.  

I reckon it'd probably sound like those ambulance sirens that keep
changing pattern to stop you habituating.  Or maybe it would just sound
rubbish.

DOUBLE CODE OUT CONTROVERSY CASTS DOUBT ON VIABILITY OF AGGRESSIVE 
PROGRAMMING

A controversial double code out in the ninth amidst claims of underhand 
deals has cast the ownership of the WPF fingerweight belt into contention. 
Legal discussions of the sport's governing body continue today to resolve 
the fate of the contest, dubbed the 'Battle of the Belge'. A speedy 
resolution has been overshadowed by allegations and counter allegations of 
underhand deals. Both fighters have made public assertions that they had 
not been paid to throw the match, but suspicion in betting circles 
continues, particularly over the case of one Stockwell based punter who may 
have deliberately misled officials both as to his real gambling intentions 
and possible links to the WPF and the athletes.

Code sports fans had been prepared for a titanic struggle, and in the first 
rounds saw a series of twists, with live coded fx units for piggy back 
processing, manic perl scripting, interpreted function substitution, 
massive bass sounds, self modifying code, SynthDef subversions and 
accidental soundfile explosions. But no-one was expecting the fork 
bomb/grain choke finale. Possible complicity between the contestents is 
supported by documentary robot footage of the two whispering to each other 
at the end of the eight round while locked in a 186 bpm dancehall embrace.

Live coding fights are a speciality sport gaining interest on the 
underground arts scene. Not without critics, an enraged musician was heard 
to declare that the musical level was 'not much above bear baiting'. 
Respected MC (Machine Controller) Q-Type was in the audience and has also 
asserted a suspicion as to the level of presets used when on the ropes, 
though he admitted that the programming in some rounds had been genuinely 
on-the-fly.

how about the best (asymptotically)?
Kolmogorov Complexity. The problem is that it was
already reduced to the halting problem. :-)

And I'm not sure that predictability is closely
related to stetics. White noise and Stockhausen is
hard to predict. The beats in house music and La Monte
Young music are harder.

Markov chains do a great job. pherhaps by applying
hidden markov models to the language dave is building
would be nice because it would always yeld compilable

hi all,

Alan Blackwell and I wrote a paper on 'The Programming Language as a 
Musical Instrument' from the perspective of human computer interaction, 
which I've made public here in case anyone is curious:

http://www.cus.cam.ac.uk/~nc272/papers/pdfs/proglangasmusicinstr.pdf

It's for the Psychology of Programming Interest Group conference at the end 
of this month where Alan is presenting it and will hopefully show Ade's 
TOPLAP video on our behalf.

btw, I contributed the central parts waffling about laptop music, live 
coding history, and the ChucK (pre Audicle) vs Ableton Live analysis, plus 
a bit at the end about maintenance. All the rest is Alan's hard work. It's 
written for HCI people so might be a bit entry level on music issues for 
some points.

interesting article...thanks...


I remember when I was studying software engineering,
that often comparison to other engineering practices
and methodologies were used. The one I most remember
is that people don't just go out and try and build a
bridge, let it fall down, and try again. And this is
why requirements analysis, specification, design,
implementation was needed. It would prove too
expensive and dangerous else.

I was always thinking that if I could build a bridge
like I could write code, then I would. And with CAD,
perhaps you now can.

Software engineering practice has borrowed methologies
from other engineering practices, and assumed that is
how it should work. In many ways it has been
sucessful, but has tending to repress other
methodologies and practices.


I was also wondering about comparison to performance
of music. I kind of think of live coding compared to
improvised music, more than performance of pre-scored
music even if awareness and adaption of what you are
doing is needed.=20

I can see dimensions
enduser programming <----->professsional programming

improvised realtime programming <----- > non real

From: "Dave Griffiths" <dave


hi livecoders,

well, sonar was great fun for me, even if I managed to miss nearly
everything except stuff I had to turn up and do (sorry Paul, meant to mak=
e
it to your talk and try to meet you but got lost wandering around)

the slub vs nebogeo gig seemed popular with the crowd - a great reaction
at the end as the music built up to such a crescendo that it broke ade's
laptop ;)

a couple of friends of mine in the audience enjoyed it, and importantly,
got the core idea behind what we were doing (I deliberately tried to avoi=
d
explaining much to them beforehand) - but had some observations, mainly
along the lines that it all looked quite confusing what was going on -
despite the huge projections.

simplifying interfaces and code is something we could investigate. also
building up slower and trying to start all code from scratch makes things
easier for the audience to follow - it may be more to do with our nervous
state (well mine anyway) at playing a large crowd that the temptation is
to throw everything together too quickly, and load chunks of code I know
work.

anyway, I made quite a lot of changes to fluxus in the days before sonar,
there is a new release availible here:
http://www.pawfal.org/Software/fluxus/
plus a sneakily stolen photograph of the performance in the screenshots
section :)

cheers,

dave

Hi all,

Yep sonar was great fun, my only regret was not being able to enjoy (and
react to) Dave's live video, it being projected behind us.  We discussed
putting a screen in front of us to solve this problem...

Yes I think the huge projections suggested that people were supposed to
know what was going on.  I think the audio livecoding should be
obfuscated.

I missed Paul Webb's talk too but heard rumours that it didn't mention
TOPLAP or TOPLAP members, and even worse, that he ordered the
technicians to take his screen off the projected screens for his
performance.  Could this be true Paul?

Dorkbotgent was great fun too, a very nice weekend of upset waitresses,

actually - I saw some funky back-projected-on-transparent-screen monitors

I agree, the sonar gig was my best livecoding experience I think, and I
managed to write a fairly complex script from scratch - which actually
suited the music better than the prewritten scriptlets that I had in
reserve.

Hi to all, this is my first post here. I witnessed the slub+nebogeo
live-coding performance at sonar and, honestly, it was the most
interesting thing I saw during the festival (I only attended the day
events though).

I understand your previous comments about code obfuscation, but I also
agree with Dave's early comment about coding from scratch to let the
audience grasp what it's all about. I don't necessarily mean you
should write the synthesis engine on-stage, but I think that some
scripts from scratch would help in this direction.

Still, I don't think the point is that everyone should "understand"
the code as programmers, but instead realize that you are indeed
coding live. I wonder if part of the audience just though it was
merely a conceptual thing to project the text screens...

Anyway, my congratulations to both Dave and Slub. It was a great
performance (here we're still commenting how you dealt with the
situation when the mac running pure-events crashed). The final fork()
was amazing.

Cheers,

hi all,

was at sonar too, talking about rand()%
missed the slub/negebegeo show coz i was playing too
not strictly livecode, but i did have 5 pcs and a gameboy and was running 
just my own software,
with a little bit if coding (not enuff to qualify i think though)
hope to get back on with writing my software for liveoding soon though,
looks like i got some research fundy stuff for it
was cool to see you guys though,
have fun with yr functions

I agree that understanding every line of the code is not important (I
can't understand a line of perl, but alex's performances are facinating t=
o
me).

I think my problem with obfuscation is that it could lead to a kind of
elitism, and mean that we play only for an initiate in-crowd. So I don't
think things should be dumbed down, but I personally don't like things to
be unnecessarily complicated in this way.

yes I guess that would be a good thing...
but with user interfaces there is this thing of
whether it should be intuition ( as based on previous
things experienced ) or ease of learning of how it
works.=20

when I first went to the so called intuitive graphical
user interfaces after years of DOS type things I was
totally confused for a few days until someone showed
me.=20


I suppose there are many forces at work in designing a
language for live coding, some in conflict with
others. For example to make it more intuitive to an
audience could be that the language has a more natural
language feel, without strange syntax. And on the
other hand perhaps this makes it more long-winded for
getting the code up in the first place and being able
to quickly change things when they need it.

maybe too, if there are too many live coding languages
the audience gets more confused. Maybe some language
standards would need to be put in place.


would make an interesting study. the audience's idea
of what is going on to the code changes. is it a
simple matter of when lots of code get changed or lots
of typing occurs they expect a big change, and when a
couple of  numbers change they expect a small change
to the sound/music.

personally I still at the stage of experimenting at
home, figuring out how to live code some good sound
stuff in real-time, and the audience has not even
started to be a concern, yet alone wanting to do
something in public at the moment. Maybe later after
doing some actual stuff and talking to auduence I can
make changes to the language I am using to help them.=20

its not that the language made has to be based on
other programming languages. The lanuage itself used
could have other artistic concerns that could
communicate with the audience and still work on some
practical live coding of sound level...could be a
quite high level poetic language which gets
interpreted into sound...

maybe a command line poetic that generates then alters
the sound

I'd like to see more of this, I've found (more or less accidently) that
scheme is a very suitable language for live coding due to it's concise
nature. Which interpreter are you using?

As a Lisp/Scheme hacker I think it's great that Scheme is finding  
favour with livecoders. I am also interested to know what dialect  
people are using, and what kind of editor they are using whilst  
coding live. I can't imagine coding Lisp without a syntax  
highlighting editor to keep track of the parentheses, but possibly  
I'm just a wuss. :-)

I'm learning scheme by live coding, probably not to be recommended. It's
such a ancient and beautiful language though.

Bizzare how the names car and cdr originally came from the machine code
instructions from one of these:

I wrote my own text editor, in OpenGL so it could be rendered on top of
the  fluxus graphics engine. Parentheses highlighting was an early featur=

I've been using a customized version of TinyScheme (a scheme  
interpreter written in C) which has been tied directly into a C++  
synthesis/scheduling engine I've been building in parallel.  This  
basically allows me to call C++ methods from scheme and scheme  
functions from C++ (which is kinda nice for creating quasi recursive  
scheme functions with precisely timed callbacks - very useful for  
musical structures).  I'm currently investigating extending the  
synthesis/scheduling engine to support AudioUnits (both instruments  
and effects) which would provide impromptu with the ability to create  
AU chains and manipulate AU parameters at runtime.

I've also recently built a simple IDE (read text editor) for  
impromptu (which is displayed in the picture) that does syntax  
highlighting, brace matching, formatting etc.  The idea is to extend  
this into a collaborative editor a la subethaedit.  At the moment,  
impromptu supports multiple users working in the same runtime but  
obviously a collaborative text editing environment would also enhance  
this significantly.

It's nice to see there is so much activity in this community at the  
moment.  It's a shame everyone is so spread out, or maybe that's just  
me in Australia :)

The wiki has suddenly been getting a lot of spam, so last night I
reverted to a 3 day old backup (hope no-one had made edits in that time)
and made the wiki database read only.

Not sure about the best way to go from here...  The 'captcha' code did
seem to be working but I lost the code for that when a hard drive died.
The wiki were currently using makes reverting versions difficult.
Perhaps the best solution is to switch again to something like
mediawiki, which is better geared towards fending off spam attacks...

I was going to hack in a password but didn't get around to it, i just
made the database readonly.

I've installed mediawiki which is well developed (it's the wikipedia

Subject: [livecode] time and livecoding
From: alex <alex
Date: Fri, 12 Aug 2005 16:18:12 +0100



I've been thinking about how difficult the relationship between time and
programming is.  In fact I've been thinking that certain kinds of
programming might happen outside of time.  When programming, it often
doesn't feel as though I'm working towards a whole, but that I've
started with a whole in my head and am jumping around it until I've
visited and described every part of it, at which point it exists in an
executable state inside the computer.  It doesn't feel like a journey,
more like the simultaneous setting together of different pieces.  When a
program is complete, it's a surprise, a snapping out as I realise there
is nothing more to do, a snapping back in to linear time as I prepare to
run the program I've written.

However while I'm programming I'm getting a bit older, and so are the
people around me.  So if during a performance I step out of time to see
an idea as a whole timeless structure and transfer it into a computer,
where does that leave co-performers, or indeed the audience?

Somehow part of me still has to be aware of the music that is developing
while another part of me is in the timeless world of programming.
Livecoding compounds the problem - the program is executing linearly
while I am thinking non-linearly.

I think this is why my from-scratch livecoding in a musical

Subject: [livecode] livecoding on rez fm
From: "Dave Griffiths" <dave


Hi all,

I'm going to be doing some livecoding (if the lsystem thing is livecoding=

still not sure) on resonance fm in an hour or two:
http://www.resonancefm.com/ (19.00 BST) Openlab clear spot - all about
free sofware and music/art

I only have ten minutes or so to play, so I'm going to cheat a little and
start with some presaved bits.

perhaps there is a spectacle in seeing livecoders wrestle with time

back up from such constructions, I am ready to perform in real-time more 
effectively while someone else submerges.

Hmmm,

Im not sure how this relates to other peoples performances,
but i tend to start with some basic and easily reconstructable devices,
such as drawable wavetables and toggle sequence note lists.
>From then on its where things get a bit more hazy, bt hopefully by then
there is enough meat on the audio bones to allow for some room to play.
I agree that a small group is best, as the differnet players can compose and 
commit their ideas
at different intervals and fill for each other. But all this is similar to 
traditional
improv, basing on a particular scale and backing up for someone elses solos.
I admit that less composition takes place 'offline' (ie in the performers 
scratch space brain)
and more happens in a fluid way with the instrument, but this just goes back 
to the old
immediacy of physical instrument/ dislocation of programming thing....
I dont think u will ever be able to get rid of this dislocation as
instruments are designed to be played as fluidly as possible for the 
specific purpose of
making music, Programming is of course not..
Programming encourages all the the mental acrobatics that alex mentioned, 
its a different medium, ofcourse.
DOesnt bother me though, i quite like watching someone slave over a hot 
command line,
only to hear some error and watch them sweatily recompile.. its all part of 
the fun
and better than listning to a wave file... (or is it ;)... only jokin..

I agree completely, the ridiculousness of the situation makes livecoding
fun. We're using languages designed for slow considered construction of
programs that extract information from databases (apparently nearly all
programming boils down to that task). It's a battle - too right! :)

you're talking extreme livecoding: http://www.pairprogramming.com/
we should try sharing computers some time.

When I've been properly livecoding fluxus (ie starting with an empty
script) I've often found myself having to flip between these mindstates,
and it really takes the pressure of a live performance to get into this
properly, it goes something like this:

1. goal driven : make something (usually a cube) move to the sound
2. intuitive   : play with the camera a bit
3. goal driven : increase the complexity - add some tree recursion
4. intuitive   : add some blur, play with colours, ahhh
5. goal driven : deform the shapes in a more interesting manner
6. intuitive   : try some textures
7. goal driven : write a function that modifies the texture coords
8. intuitive   : play with the camera some more

It's like the two sides of my brain taking turns. I also tend to write
some code in a forward thinking planned way, then go back over it
changing numbers in a totally absent minded experimental way - I think
you actually have a way of doing this automatically, don't you alex?

>From my experience, I think it's a lot easier in a way, doing visuals to
sound, as you have an implicit source of data - I can get away with
going into the programming "zone" for a while as stuff still reacts to
the incoming sound automatically. I find audio performances more
demanding - especially solo.

I think there are two points really, there is the punk rock side of
livecoding that wants to get a load of robots playing classical
instruments, programmed live with cobol. And there is the "is this a
better way of making music" argument which is a lot harder to justify,
but maybe not as important. 

Maybe trying to design a language specifically for the job, and not
necessarally a text based one, would be in interesting project.

I don't doubt there is massive room for improvement in livecoding
languages but I don't think the fault is all in the language.  There are
languages designed for big maintainable applications, and there are
languages designed for quick hacks.  I happen to use one designed for
quick hacks :)  It seems quite suitable for me.

I think the problem is that we are communicating in rich, usually
textual languages and that richness comes with necessary overhead.

Although saying that it strikes me that body language is also very rich
and doesn't come with this overhead.  But then body language is only
rich when it is subconscious, once you try to control it, it becomes
shallow and simplistic.

In that case our problem is that we are using 'higher' brain functions.

Yes!

Not really, it's possible to get the code to edit the variable
declarations in its own source-code but that's fairly pointless as it
has access to the variables in memory anyway.  That's only useful as an
easy way of saving state.  In that case I usually save the state in
comments and then have the code read back values from those comments...
Somehow its easier that way.

Interesting...  It's a well-visited idea to take environmental
parameters for a live music performance, but I think it would be just as
valid for a livecoding musician to write code that reacts to light
changes triggered by an engineer, or take parameters from a livecoding
VJ about the how busy/big/intense etc their VJing forms are.

And of course you can write some code that makes music that develops
over time by itself.  An interesting area of livecoding research I
think...  Writing something live that happens in five minutes.

For me it's absolutely a better way of music.  I can't play musical
instruments very well, and was getting really fed up with running
pre-written scripts, without feeling compelled to develop them further.
I was trying to collaborate with improvising musicians and getting
nowhere because I just couldn't react to what they were doing fast
enough.

And of course as Julian points out, playing live is only one option for
a livecoder.  Livecoding seems a perfect way to compose in general...
It's like describing your musical style to a computer, then playing with
it there to find a composition within.

That sounds like another reason not to rely on coding from scratch in
front of a live audience actually....  If writing something from scratch
is an attempt to define a new style, whereas manipulating a new script
is an attempt to develop your style.  In those terms, which sounds the
most sensible approach? :)

I've done pair programming at work, and it speeds up code development so
much that you get more out than the two people working alone. maybe the
same would be true for live coding?

yes - more input. I'd like to livecode music where I had some form of dat=
a
from the crowd. I think we could do a lot by using more devices like Amy'=
s
dance mat - it would mean we start to use more muscles and less mind.

well it's the only way I can make music live - I wouldn't feel right
mixing pre-made tracks, and I can't play an instrument to save my life :)

I think for me (maybe because of my background) livecoding has more in
common with a visual art. When I'm painting, I have a similar concept in
my head - switching between planning from a high level what's going on,
and applying the paint, both informing each other.

I still think the from scratch approach works best for me, just because i=
t
feels more exciting (although I can't depend on it entirely yet). I think
development has to progress through building the environment in which you
work, writing libraries of often used bits of code, so your building
blocks are more useful. We are programmers after all :)

I don't think data should come from a crowd, only individuals...
Collective decisions tend towards a lowest common denominator, a
flattening out...

Very interesting...  I want to try some visual livecoding soon.  I heard
from dorkbotmadrid Javier there's a .deb of fluxus around?

Isn't it always this weird intermediate, conflicting area between 
perception and unconscious that is so fascinating?

There is considerable research going on in this field which shows 
that body language, just as spoken language (and I would say language 
necessarily) has to deal with exactly this type of 'overhead'. The 
main reason is the fact that communication has to do with planning 
ahead. This (often unconcious) planfulness works exactly because it 
can fail in so many ways (we typically react by so called 'repairs').

For me this is the most interesting thing about live coding. I think 
every program is a limitation, as it is a kind of plan. This is why 
it works. To be able to change plans while they are already in the 
process of realisation is a feature that we have in dynamic 
programming languages. But I think the question how this is best 
achieved is not trivial (our ICMC paper is about this, so maybe we 
can discuss these issues there a bit as well).

What makes interactivity? How would you define it, considering that 
action  always impiles a certain planfulness or expectation?

You're working on something more musically inclined aren't you? I've been
looking forward to seeing/hearing that.

Perhaps we need to start a low level microcode art thing. I really like

Subject: [livecode] re: time and livecoding



Hi Alex and all--

	Wow, reading that clarifies for me why I find livecoding so interesting.

	I have a fair amount of prior musical performance experience. What I've 
always liked most about it was that conversational aspect of it, the 
exchange with others. Late-bound computer programming environments had 
some of that feel, too (especially the message-oriented one I usually 
use). But the topic of conversation was never as interesting. :)

	So bringing them together makes perfect sense to me. And the main 
nicety of the programming environment (never having to stop or restart) 
turns out to be critical. The conversations can continue and evolve ad 
infinitum. I think not having to restart goes a long way toward 
diffusing the tension of programming-in-the-moment. It does rather feel 
like painting to me, too (as Dave mentioned). To run with that allusion 
a bit, I guess having to restart a livecoding programming conversation 
would be like having to copy bits of previous work to a new canvas 
whenever one wants to make a significant change to a painting.

	It's no surprise to me that the system I'm developing is "literally" 
conversational (using English). It's just a hack to make the language of 
the conversation more accessible to the audience. (I wrote "musique 
litterale", which is a sort of musical interactive fiction.)

	By the way, right now I'm experimenting with including individual 
audience members in the conversation, by bridging my system with AOL 
Instant Messenger. I have my doubts, both because audience members would 
probably be typing using cellphones, which is cumbersome, and because 
musique litterale normally listens character-by-character, not 
line-by-line like most IM systems. But we'll see. :)

Subject: BETA:Composition, Technology and Beyond BETA:Composition,=20


BETA: Composition, Sound, Technology and beyond
Friday 30th September - Sunday 2nd October 2005

Over the past 10 years FACT has specialised in working with a wide
variety of artists, exhibitors and technologists to explore the
creative potential of new media tools.

We are now aiming to bring together practitioners, composers, performers,
researchers and  writers academic or otherwise working with sound,
composition, improvisation, DSP, information,  net, open source, the open
compositioin and generative based technology for a 3 day conference
programme looking at the areas where these fields and creative processes
overlap.

Building on the success of previous projects working with
artists from the visual arts, media and dance, this project will
support an open dialogue between all of the creative partners.

It will support and develop an understanding of some of the
methods, processes and tools employed in these areas in order that we may
be able to seed new  ways of working.

The conference will be facilitated by FACT, but will feature guest
presentations, talks, lectures,  performances, actions and workshops by
specialists within these fields as guest speakers.  Similarly delegates
will be invited from across the fields of sound, composition and =
technology.

There will be a critical discourse as a background and primer to the
conference in the form of  discussion panels at the start and end of the
programme.

Interest and format

Proposals for any contributions, presentations, lectures or interest in the
conference should be  sent to dalzielross@hidden

The project also welcomes any input that strays from more traditional
lecture formats; virtual  lectures & appearances, cryptic messages and
emailed sets of instructions for delegates, objects  or text sent in the
post, a radio programme, cd's to be listened to on headphones, overhead
projector performances, drawings, compositions, photographs, mp3s, software
demos, file  sharing, website bookmarks.

Some Primers and questions

The aims of the conference are to bring together strands of thinking and
practice that could help  develop future ways of working with technology,
sound and composition.

What are the models for music composition, performance and creativity when
new technology is  involved? What are open compositions and how do they
relate to technology? Do we need  computers to make advanced, open creative
composition, sound and music? What is generative and information based
composition and how does advanced composition or  contemporary music use
technology? To what extent does new technology continue to influence/
develop musical theory and creativity?
How is contemporary composition and sound art feeding back into
technological development?  How is science influencing composition?

I abstained from "writing from scratch" as I had during the sonar
performance. What I found however, was it was actually quite successful
loading from my library of scripts and modifying them to suit the music. =
I
could concentrate more on the quality of the sounds and make stuff happen
according to what you two were playing. Due to this, I think the actual
results were better :)

I guess a large part of how "pure" your live coding should be depends on
the setting and the time availible. Longer and purer live coding
performances are likely to be slow moving and more suitable for specialis=
t
audiences, who are actually interested in seeing a program written in
front of them. In a club on a saturday night, you need things to be faste=
r
moving, but live coding still gives you much more flexibility than fader
tweaking.

Too right!

Thanks again u-sun, for putting up with our late appearance - and putting

Subject: [livecode] ChucK vs SuperCollider feedback


(original script by Nick, some improvisational flourishes by Gregory 
Taylor, our kind referee, and some real improvisation once we fought)

scene: a sweaty and humid gallery in downtown Barcelona, 7th Sept 2005.

Ref: Ladies and Gentlemen, I'm Max MSP.

Welcome to the 2005 Live Coding Championship Final for the disputed World 
Programming Federation Fingerweight Belt (hosted under the kind auspices of 
off-ICMC and Metronom).

Plato vs Aristotle, Mozart vs Clementi, Kasparov vs Deep Blue, Cause vs 
Effect...all of these are nothing compared to what you will witness 
tonight.

Pure, raw, unadulterated algorithm!

Two laptops, two screens, a fierce rivalry of programming communities...

They said we fixed fights, they said we are often silent for a long time 
before we make any noise, they said all this and more, but I'm here to tell 
you: it doesn't get any more algorithmic than this.

(rabble rouse etc, are you ready to rumble...)

In the ChucK corner, the ceaseless programmer, the man who doesn't sleep, 
the prince of Princeton, the Chef, We Gang!

(Ge enters stage right, towel around neck, chef's hat, ChucK partisans 
cheer)

In the SuperCollider corner, a controversial dualist from the previous 
WPFFB fight, he floats like a butterfly, stings like a b..b..cut... all the 
way from glorious Sweden, I give you...Click Nilson!

(Nick enters stage left wearing boxing gloves, SuperCollider partisans 
cheer)

Ge and Nick lock heads, separated by Greg, growl at each other.

Go to laptops.

Contest starts...



Some feedback from the bout (additional comments welcomed from those who 
were there, especially Ge- sorry if any of this sounds one sided):

David Wessel accurately observed that there was a lot of extra musical 
content, and was skeptical (like many of us) about the depth of programming 
possible under those pesky realtime constraints.

Ge had had 2 hours sleep in the previous 48 so wasn't at peak form, but 
still attempted to recompile ChucK during the concert, and led at the 
beginning via presets.

Nick was quiet at the beginning for about 7 minutes while he coded from 
scratch based on the Babylonian square root algorithm. Later on he used 
more preset material when Ge became quiet.

Inevitably there was much we could have done but forgot to because of the 
stresses of the audience. Personally I regret not doing a code out ending 
via infinite spawn loop or similar.

It was interesting that the audience actually expected a true alternation 
of gestures at the beginning. We could perhaps work more on this, with one 
coding while another plays. This would probably be v.difficult to do well, 
however, without resorting to presets and some slight adaptation of those 
to circumstances.

We need to keep practising and force ourselves to get used to audience 
scrutiny. I'd practised every day for the week leading up but still 
performed somewhat worse than I'd hoped on the night. And it might be worth 
formalising some bout rules... for the moment, the bouts remain draws...

Subject: Re: [livecode] ChucK vs SuperCollider feedback


Some feedback from one who was there.

As a show it was nice. The concept of a battle, the
funny presentation from the referee, ge's hat and
nick's gloves, both daring each other through your
comments... It was nice to see some humor in what
otherwise could have been a cold academic event. I
agree with what you say of a "true alternation of
gestures". I guess that if you present it so
spectacularly as a fight, people expect some fighting
in turns. Something like some rounds with five minutes
for each player or so could enhance the feeling of a
battle.=20

Visually speaking, I was impressed by ge's projection.
I'm not sure if that was the audicle or the sndtools
or whatever, but i hope that they release it soon to
get my hands dirty.=20

On the other hand, I think I prefer to see more code.
But on a side note I must confess that, never having
programmed supercollider myself(although I code other
languages), I didn't understand a word of nick's code
(I'm thinking of the amount of the process that the
non-coder casual listener can get).=20

Then music-wise, I really liked it. Both approaches
were different (despite the presets vs from scratch
thing) ge being more rithmic and nick more deep
sounding, but both enjoyable by themselves,
independently from the show (aren't any of you
thinking of releasing an album or whatever). I
particularly loved nick's bass sounds. Deeeeeep.

And last... it was so short for me, but I know that's=20
not your fault.

Some guys from galicia recorded two videos of the
show, one with the presentation and one of the concert
(but just the first part, no click nilson there. You

Subject: Re: [livecode] ChucK vs SuperCollider feedback


hi jesus, greetings from the uk. How are your own ChucK adventures coming 
along (I think that's the system you're exploring?)

thanks for the feedback, its really nice to hear from people who were there 
(and the video took me back, hilarious, thanks for the link). I think we're 
definitely in the exploratory stage still where we have to keep pushing 
ourselves against the challenges and be honest about our successes and 
failures.

My current inclination is that live coding (in the concert sense) is 
possible:

by adaptation of presets in a lower stress manner

from scratch when covered by a second party, jury out on whether any 
profound algorithms can be explored.

And both of these can of course look esoteric. Perhaps some of us need to 
add some coding shortcuts to our languages for self-commented pseudo code 
like writing (Loop, CompositionTask, makesound etc) so as to move towards 
the accessibility of Craig's interface, though I doubt that process can be 
taken that far if we're still going for the profound algorithm from scratch 
goal. But yes, (speaking for myself), coding a few classes that save typing 
and whose constructs are evident to an audience would be helpful- it's the 
old 'what is the fair blank slate' problem. Perhaps we're going to be up 
against charges of being a relatively closed guild and lacking embodiment 
for all time unless there is some universal tangible interface language 
that develops out of algorithmic literacy in people's home lives...

best,
N

interesting point.
one thing to say, free software != free as in beer
there are (and always have been) tons of closed source zero cost
programs around. 

the business of writing programs has become more of a service industry
these days it seems to me. I think this is a good thing.

I don't think the "open sourceness" of an application automatically
makes a piece of software more creatively useful. You get great closed
source apps and you get rubbish open source ones, obviously. 

The thing is that the software alex is talking about has had the
advantage of being driven by forces other than a marketing department.
These forces *tend* to work in a more interesting creative direction -
rather than having to appeal to a marketplace with the latest must-have
features/user interface gimmicks. It is this, I think, which is a little
breath of fresh air for a lot of people. This isn't exclusive to free
software, clearly - but it is inherent in the method of it's production.

I think it's a lot stronger argument for the artist who is willing to
become the programmer, as using free software immediately allows you a
much greater ability to define a creative process which is more
personal. This does not apply at all to a lot of people (sadly imho).

cheers,

dave

I'm not sure what the connection between artists and shareware is here.
Maybe you're suggesting that artists don't like doing proper marketing,
and prefer shareware's viral marketing?  Or is there some shareware art
culture I haven't heard about?

I think the real opportunity for individuals to make money from software

Hi Alex.

what this has to do with artists is that artist do
need to make some kind of income, and I think it is
preferably that this money is earned from doing their
work, rather than have to go out and do work they
perhaps don't want to do.  So make money from doing
festivals, exhibitions, selling their work, doing
talks. Or writing software and trying to sell it. Like
how "fine artists" sell their work.
I would rather it was the case that artists could do
their stuff and not have to worry about income. But
this is not the case... and is likely to get worse.


I have found over the last 10 years that people expect
more and more that experimental software (whether it
is classed as artistic or not) should be free. Maybe
this is my experience. And others in the free software
movement I have spoken to about have agreed that free
software has meant people think s/w should be free.
But they don't see it as a problem. Maybe it isn't.

I don't know if there is a shareware s/w art culture.
But maybe this is just part of s/w art culture in
which the artists  sell their work. Which I think is
small.=20

am I making any sense.,,
probably not

I agree my point wasn't well argued, but I still don't feel like I was
playing to the free software world, just small groups already around
this software.  To me the free software world seems uncomfortable with
the idea of writing software to make art.

> and really - open source people don't flatter each other?

Well John McCartney certainly doesn't.  In any case as a 'user' I think
it's difficult to feel flattered by the creators of Supercollider, PD or
processing.

There are differences in how that expression gets externalised though,
as a sequence of sounds or as instructions to make a sequence of sounds.
True, that difference isn't in height, but abstraction.  But if you have
that abstraction you can think outside of linear time more easily, in a
place where one change can alter everything.

Bidule seems like an open environment from a closed source which spoils
my point somewhat.  Im looks like you can choose to build from sinewaves
if you want to.  But still I bet there are super easy automatic music
generating features in there to draw in new users.

I'd hate the future of computer music to look like this:
http://www.linuxmusician.com/ .  But I think that's very unlikely, I
think computer music communities grow and progress around free software
in ways that aren't available around closed software.

Yes.

I also think Alex is maintaining the position that the artist-as-coder
creates software-as-art (or art-as-software), whereas a lot of this
discussion is not necessarily about the same thing. If you're a musician
artist making music on a computer (like Paul S), do you need to be able to
code? If you can, is the music you are producing what you finally hear, or
the software that you build? What if you just want to make music? Surely
it doesn't matter if you're using free or proprietary software, since it's
the artist's choice entirely, and that's a significant part of the final
artwork?

I'm not sure I follow this yet. An artist who wants to code will pick up
the tools of coding (all well and good) - but why would going to existing
open source software be beneficial? Saying this makes the assumption that
all artists need to take existing source code as a starting point, which
I'm not sure is strictly true. And this is where we get weird arguments
about writing your own sine generators. For some artists, this will be
appropriate, but not all.

Personally I feel the entire free/open vs proprietary/closed argument is a

you don't have to at all, but it sure helps. personally speaking, I've
mainly written new applications, but I can say that I wouldn't have got
nearly as far if I wasn't using free libraries, had a lot of example code
in the form of existing working apps and most importantly a community of
amazingly helpful people (users and developers). I think this whole
shebang is what most people are actually thinking about when they talk
about free software.

I think it's important to add that a lot of commercial software has open
api's for extending via plugin interfaces - this is great, but not quite
the same thing.

yes, and there is a kind of fundamentalism surrounding some areas of the

I think there are two points really which are both highly debatable:

1. programming makes computer artists more productive
2. free software makes programmers more productive

The first one is the interesting one, and is on topic for a list about

I think this is very true. And why the whole open

Agreed, but I think the first point needs some work.  We should make
clear that we're talking about computer artists programming themselves,
rather than paying someone else to do so, indirectly or otherwise;

  "Computer artists who program their work are more productive."

Is "productive" really the right word though?  It suggests that they
produce a lot of work, but doesn't say anything about the quality of
work.  So how about something like:

  "Computer artists who program their work produce better work, more
quickly."

As we've acknowledged before, 'programming' is also ambiguous.  You
program a sequencer and an alarm clock for example.  So perhaps we
should be more specific.  TOPLAP are interested in interactive
programming, and mostly using imperative languages.

  "Computer artists can produce better work more quickly through
programming with imperative and functional languages."

However, that doesn't include MAX/MSP or PD, and I'm not sure how to
refer to them properly, the best I can do is 'modular':

  "Computer artists can produce better work, more quickly through the
use of programming languages, particularly imperative languages such as
SuperCollider, ChucK, Java, BASIC, C/C++ and Perl, functional languages
such as lisp and scheme, and modular languages such as MAX and Pure
Data."

Of course as TOPLAP we'd want to add something about live programming,
perhaps with the word 'interactive':

  "Computer artists can produce better work, more quickly through the
interactive use of programming languages, particularly imperative
languages such as SuperCollider, ChucK, Java, BASIC, C/C++ and Perl,
functional languages such as lisp and scheme, and modular languages such
as MAX and Pure Data."

Now it sounds like a marketing soundbite.  Perhaps if we improved it
further it could form part of a revised TOPLAP manifesto?

I think there are two threads to this "produce better work, more quickly"
argument too.

1. An artist may find that programming an application allows them to do
things that the existing tools do not allow.

2. An artist may write an program and declare it as an artifact in it's
own right.

1 is more traditional (code as tool). A programming artist may be able to
make things in a different way to everyone else - and therefore the work
can be pushed further than previously availible tools made possible.

2 I have a lot more trouble with (code as art) even though I've had a go
at writing some. I have always found it hard to accept as it stands, and
the arguments either way all seem a little contrived.

One of the things I really like about livecoding toplap style is that it
effectively sidesteps this troublesome question completely, as the writin=
g
of the code is the performance, the code is sort of an intrument, the
manipulation of it is the artform, rather than the "code as itself".

Seems to fit a bit better to me.

Another slightly unconnected thing I like to think about is that code is =
a
(if not "the") raw material of the computer. Artists who pay attention to
their raw materials are generally on to a good thing.

Just avoiding writing "code as paid work" on a monday :)

also, don't forget, PD grew out of Max/MSP, which is not open source and 
is now fully commercial/proprietary/expensive. (though it had an academic 
history, afaik it never was open source.) but commercial or not, still it 
does not flatter the user. flattery doesn't bother me so much anyway - 
flattering features can be ignored in either case, and all software 
imposes restrictions whether overt like "wizards" or less obvious (e.g., 
the patch model presents its own restrictions, although it certainly 
facilitates some things. where do we draw the line between "facilitating" 
and "taking over?"

hmm, patch model, that's based on hardware synths, they too were an 
amalgam of opening possibilites up and closing them down. 

anyway, i think the distinction may be closer to "software written by an 
individual" or "software written by an 'artist'"  vs. "software written by

i have no idea about bidule, but it still doesn't bother me even if it 
does, as long as it also has the functionality to do things on one's own. 
in fact, it might be helpful to give newbies a test drive with training 
wheels on so they can have some idea how the thing works and whether they 
want to delve into it for real. sure, 10,000 people will make recordings 
with the same preset, but that'll be its own punishment; that's been going 
on at least since the "macpaint aesthetic."

Not a small part of the last hundred years of arts have been about 
the questioning of the idea of productivity in society as well as the 
blurring between the artists' 'tools' and their 'product' (e.g. dada, 
surrealism, fluxus, site specific art). I think that you are right to 
emphasize that the it is better to speak of coding as art than code 
as art. Speed of production might be an aesthetic element ("futurist 
livecoding"?), but I think it is not correct to take over an economic 
term of productivity uncritically.

Regarding your point 2, I would want to add that this is a very 
problematic issue in law: Formally, a program (and the programming 
language) does not have to be declared as an artifact (copyright 
work), but it already is. This is important in the discussion whether 
a program can be subject to a patent. I wonder under what 
circumstances code is perceived as part of art, i.e. as literature.

I agree - individuals write more interesting software (note: not
necessarily more useful :) but if the user also happens to be the writer
then the artist/programmer is more than the sum of it's parts, or
something... this has nothing whatsoever to do with free software (except
it's slightly easier to cross over that boundry than with closed systems)=
.

the main contribution free software has to give to art (and the rest of
the world for that matter) is a political/philosophical one. I think this
does tie in with livecoding, in the exposing of working methods, the
celebration of the raw algorithm and removing the childish secrecy of muc=

computer art.

Images that can take a life of their own, moving from static to dynamic,
form becoming growth.

This workshop will introduce 'fluxus'[2] as a programming and performing
environment for real-time animation. We will cover a range of animation
techniques, from basic geometry, motion, texturing and compositing to mor=

and network data. The participants will learn how to make inanimate bits

It might depend on the mapping model of the sonification. Chess is a 
language (I would suspect that it is not turing-complete though). 
Each momentary state in the chess game describes an algorithm of what 
to do next (for example you could sonify what a chess computer does 
when iterating over a reasonably large number of possible moves). The 
similarity could be imagined as that of a force field of possible 
futures implied by a grammar that causes double-meaning. Sound is 
caused by this double-readablity.

In this piece I think the sonification is simple, just whether a 
certain field is 'stood on', or not, matters. Maybe we should give 
that a proper term, being maybe one possible trajectory extreme of 
live coding. Side-effect-Art? Symbolic Involuntarism? Language-Gaming?

btw. by art historians this is considered a joke. Duchamp continued

definitely a candidate for 'changing grammars'.

hi julian, I always like your reflections...

The entire sonification is established beforehand. So there are no (human) 
changes to the audio algorithm itself in performance and you might say no 
live coding. You also aren't allowed to change the rules of chess itself 
during play.

I take your point that there are many chess playing strategies, and the 
player can of course switch on the fly, but then this is a property of 
general cognition- hmm, which spin axis of entangled particle A shall I 
measure? So if cognition= computation then all human action is live coding 
as we change our minds...

I guess we have preset sonification consequences here as one limit. And I 
guess I'm most interesting in the other side of the continuum, some area of 
improvised mappings and changing consequences and algorithm wrestling, and 
perhaps we haven't mapped out where that is yet (especially given human 
constraints).

>a grammar that causes double-meaning. Sound is caused by this 
double-readablity

um, not sure what you mean, would appreciate clarification of the two 
meanings. Maybe I need to read more Deleuze and Kittler ; )

There is always a level at which you cannot change the rules. The 
main question regarding improvisation is when you can change a rule 
and which (this is not a question of degree but of compositional 
structure). The main point of live coding is that this happens in 
language (what counts as language is a matter of how one is urged to 
think about it). I do agree that "Reunion" is a pretty degenerate 
case of live programming.

I'd say it is one way to think in public. And to change mind in public.

what do you mean? do you have an example?

no, I have 'invented' this term ;). The code has two readers (at 
least). One that tries to understand what is going on (usually human) 
and the other that tries to do what is supposed to be going on 
(usually the computation). There is a continuous degree of 
misunderstanding between them two.

nicely put

I am reminded of the Woody Allen short story about 'intellectuals for 
hire'. Imagine a future 'blue light' district with racy 'mind shows' and 
'neuron bars'. Mind you, I suppose that this activity doesn't have to be 
over-intellectual ... depends on language, aims etc

perhaps you might live code sonifications, so there is an incoming data 
stream, perhaps the current chessboard configuration of two on stage 
performers. Now you keep modifying the mapping algorithm in terms of 
synthesis routines, parameter re-mapping, one-to-many event scheduling, 
multimodal outcomes etc

(I know you know this already but I'll just state for the record)

this is to anthropomorphise computers a little- the computer misunderstands 
very literally- in fact the human operator fails to anticipate all 
consequences or spot their coding errors. Perhaps there are three readers:

interpreter
coder
audience member

And the last one misunderstands most of all ; )

Considering way our universities are getting increasingly 
commercialized ("independent") maybe this could be their future? But 
thinking about it I guess one would need to start a 'mind show 
movement' to raise interest for such underestimated subjects such as 
the state of mind..

oh yes, of course, now I see what you meant. So it is connected to 
what we described in our icmc paper as a method interactive 
sonification. I also think this is an interesting field - Alberto and 
I recently had funny experiences live coding for classical 
clarinettes, and spanish guitars.

wait, soon we'll get shouts from the audience like "hey, you missed a

I was considering doing an Olofsson and giving up air travel, but this
does look good.  I'd be tempted to put something forward if there will
be other TOPLAP people there.

I've been experimenting with livecoded Voronoi mapping!

hi all, i live in Switzerland and i think there might be a good  
chance to try and organize a workshop here...maybe that way there can  
be some money raised to pay some tickets (from within Europe since  
its high season im afraid). If someone from toplap thinks of this as  
a good idea i might try it or contact people that can help organize  
something during the same week of the conference.  Might be the  
beginning of setting up a toplap summer tour of wksps around europe?  
that way some money could be raised...my 2 cents..

Partly because the organisers don't seem to be able to answer emails,
and partly because I'm trying to cut down in travel, I think I'll have
to give this one a miss.  Could probably be persuaded otherwise if
others are keen for a meet-up there though.

Subject: [livecode] abstraction
From: "Dave Griffiths" <dave


hi toplap

I've recently been trying to do visuals livecoding with the same code as
my music - the lsystem text thing I was doing before, but now coded in
scheme using fluxus and a lot of osc messages to tie it all together:

http://www.pawfal.org/patterncascade/
http://cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewcvs/livenoisetools/livenoisetools/pattern=
-casca
de/

The screenshots are of various ways I've tried interpreting the code, the
forms get built and animated as you write the rules for the music, so it
all becomes the same thing. I'll try and get some movies uploaded soon.

I seem to be mainly involved in building abstracted environments to
livecode in these days - wrapping lower level systems up into easy
livecodable chunks. It's gets kind of obvious that this is mainly what
programming is about really. With fluxus as an example it sort of goes:

live scripting
a Scheme script interface
fluxus Scheme binding
fluxus renderer
OpenGL
gfx driver
gfx hardware

So there is probably just as much, if not more abstraction than a GUI
would give you. I guess the difference is that right at the top of the
chain you're dealing with the same basic concepts that are present at the
bottom, while a GUI would have to translate them into something quite
different, and to some extent limited - or at least losing some of the
flexibility of the components of the machine they interface to.

Interestingly, as I learn more about Scheme, and read a book I should hav=
e
a long time ago: http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/ I find it talks a lot abou=
t
the expressive power of a programming language - particually in relation
to this abstraction building.

If anything, I think livecoding shows that there is a lot of interesting
work to be done in the realm of interface design, to make it as expressiv=
e
as a programming language in terms of telling a computer what to do.

cheers,

dave

Hi all,

For many months, the subscription process for this mailing list was
broken.  I've now fixed it, and found (hidden in a big haystack of spam)
twenty one subscription requests.

So we have some new members, please introduce yourselves - what are you
livecoding and why?  Or if you're not livecoding right now, why not?

Hm, we seem to have some annoying googlebot subscribed to the list
(thanks, "mi_ga"), am trying to track it down.

While I'm here I should probably say what I'm up to, livecode-wise...
I'm getting frustrated having to type the same rhythmic constructs over
and over when I'm livecoding music with Perl, so am now trying to make a
simpler "domain specific language" that lets me type them faster.  This
is a bit like data compression and a bit like defining what I think
rhythm is in a language.

Anyone doing anything similar?  I remember Julian talking about changing
grammars many years ago...

Ah, yes, thanks to Alex for so swiftly replying to my bug-report about the
list subscription thingy.

I'm Kassen. i've been making various forms of electronic music for a while
now.
I've also been releasing and playing some experimental techno and
sound-track-ish things and next to that I've been helping some friends make
and release disco and electro.

And when it comes down to it I don't realy like sequencers.
That's not entirely true; I like things like sequencer modules in modular
systems, especially "open" ones like the Serge TKB or various digital
emulation of things like that but Cubase, Logic and so on never worked for
me. Ableton is ok.

So; for the longest time I'd program all of my paterns in huge stacks of
Nord Modular sequencer and logic modules, then recordings of this would be
thrown into some wave editor, regioned untill my video card had trouble
dealing with it and cut up. That didn't seem to make all that much sense in
the long run so I started looking elsewhere for things that made sense to
me. These days I do use MIDI but I don't really like it, halfway into the
process it starts to feel like I'm abusing MIDI, soon therafter it looses
any semblance of order.

Currently I'm fooling around with Renoise (a tracker) and on and off with
ChucK.

Live-coding got my attention because there seems to be a certain directness
to it; my ChucK skills are hardly of a quality that would make one want to
listen to a whole piece and most certainly I wouldn't be comfortable with
people watching me write one yet but there seems to be a certain edge to
jaming with it. I've certainly been having more fun jamming with ChucK then
writing, then rendering, Csound.

So; when it comes down to it I'm simply curious what people are doing with
this stuff, how and why. I also admire the Toplap ideal of projecting your
schreen because I think there are simply too many people that are using
Ableton as a 500 bucks Winamp playlist. I feel the laptop should have the
same charm as the flute in a sheppard's pocket; a instrument you can keep
with you, write or play wherever you are so you become intimate with the
instrument; not a sort of schreen to hide your hands to keep a audience awa=
y
from your instrument.


I think that about covers it for now.

well, i for one, welcome the livecoding overlords ;)

it was 2 years ago, when people with some interest for livecoding met =20=

in hamburg.
julian rohrhuber invited people for the 'changing grammars symposium'
(http://swiki.hfbk-hamburg.de:8888/MusicTechnology/609)
it was also julian who made the jit(just-in-time)lib extension =20
classes for supercollider3
(btw. also for sc2 there was a functional jitlib by him).
this made livecoding very straightforward for all sc users, most of =20
whom untill then were not
that familiar with the possibility of starting a performance with an =20
empty text file,
and typing a concert from scratch.
i'd advise anyone with interest for 'live-coding' to have a look at =20
the jitlib example files,
and then thank julian for his great work !

personally i found that livecoding works well for fast prototyping as =20=

well as concerts,
but the addition of a few buttons and some sliders makes the whole a =20
lot easier, and more flexible too, especially in a live setting.

the jitlib way of doing sc things is, and will probably be, my =20
prefered way of making live computer music, though i do not realy =20
feel it is important to communicate this, since i cannot understand =20
why code in itself would be interesting to watch for a general public,
i guess watching visuals generated from the same code as the music =20
would help such an audience better to percieve what is going on. for =20
settings with a more 'informed' public that would be different =20
possibly..
the toplab manifesto is quite clear on this however;

	"We acknowledge that:

	=95 	 It is not necessary for a lay audience to understand =
the code to
	appreciate it, much as it is not necessary to know how to play =
guitar
	in order to appreciate watching a guitar performance.

i am not sure about this comparison, i think there's no uneducated =20
audience that appreciates code, unless they want to learn, which is =20
probable in a workshop situation.
also, because the public is very much familiar with the sound of a =20
guitar, watching the player
can be fun (just one unknown factor). a computers sound can be =20
anything, the code will not resemble anything an audience has seen =20
before (text-wise), together this might just be too much too =20
understand what is going on (which is what a public wants, =20
understanding before appreciation)
most people actually got fed-up with guitar players' solos, and their =20=

faces are funny at best.
also a laptop cannot be a fallus symbol, the way a guitar can be ;)

allthough the manifesto is (meant to be) a bit tongue-in-cheeck, it =20
could be a good thing to bring the serious points about. i think one =20
main point is, that we are not 'laptop-djs', and to communicate that =20
to a public can be quite important. there's a difference.

just my thoughts  :)

Dear Adrian -

I have been contemplating this question for some time now. How to reduce
this distance and make code transparent to a degree that the "generative"
aspect is self evident? Any kind of auxiliary visuals can only be facile
interpretations, I feel.

One way of doing this, for the TopLap performer, would be to code using a
new language.
For instance, his codes would be played only upon a 3X3 grid of
proto-symbols, which formulate the basic meanings of this language. As you
play upon this virtual board of dynamic patterns, the music and the vision
become one for the audience too, since the surprise comes to you and them a=
t
precisely the same point. It's a long shot, but an attractive one for me. I=
f
the process becomes open then we must redefine virtuosity in art by some
other yardstick - an abstract one.

I am so obviously day-dreaming that I should shut up now ;)

this is a very interesting point. This does happen with livecoding 
fairly often. (A while ago I had started to write an extension that 
would allow to write a program that causes side effects form control 
flow as well as from program text.)

I guess I'll introduce myself too.

I am Sharp Hall (sharph.net). I'm a senior in high school, and I've
done linux (and electronic music) things since the 4th grade. I use
spiralsynthmodular to make electronic music mainly (see
http://ccmixter.org/media/people/sharp), but I fool around with other
suff. I made two Perl files (http://sharph.net/em/ under "Using Perl")
that can be used to do live coding with MIDI. The code is reloaded
every "phrase" (256 ticks) and "eval'ed" every tick.
I use ALSA's virtual midi device to hook it up to amSynth just to play
around, or zynaddsubfx and specimen for some real synth and drums. I
don't have anything to show just yet, but I hope to make some tracks
with it for a new album I'm putting together.

I could do a live show if I wanted to, all I would need is an audience
and a projector.

I enjoyed reading your comments, Adrian, hope all good with you.

surely that depends on the mappings themselves. Often, people go quickly 
from direct causal physical mappings to much more abstract things (in 
audiovisual work). And the same for the abstractions of code itself, level 
can be somewhat selected. Craig's accessible text game interactions using 
natural language processing, his `adventures in live coding' are a good 
case.

> i think there's no uneducated audience that appreciates code

Amy has a great point about algorithmic literacy, and the increasing 
ubiquity of coding in our lives. Education can happen, especially if we're 
not afraid of code.

There is that physical side where causation can be observed. And we're at 
least candid about turning from the gestural past in live coding practice.

But then, a lot of electric guitar sounds come from the inner workings of 
pick-ups and amplifiers, unobservable. People got used to those sounds.

Perhaps our analogy should be more that of seeing the score an ensemble/ 
orchestra plays- this doesn't usually happen. The code is implicit score 
and the sound origin is a DAC. We are exploring new ways of adjusting 
scores during performances and the acoustic consequences from a higher 
level vantage point than playing every note.

In an interesting concert a composer might live code the scores for 
musicians during a performance. You could show the changing scores (perhaps 
the code too that changes the scores) and have the acoustic musicians there 
being physical.

> most people actually got fed-up with guitar players' solos, and their
> faces are funny at best.

And people will tire of certain cliches of live coding solos, its a natural 
facet of musical life. Fortunately it is earlier in live coding history 
than the history of guitar. We tend to explore, our curiosity drives us on. 
Who knows what eventual virtuosity will result?

using a joystick controller with the laptop helps.

probably a point in favour of the projection of laptop screens. Reveal the

Ok have talked to miga, he has some software that reads his mail and

I am actualy a PhD student working on gestural control of speech=20

Hello,

I just found even more people who had tried and failed to subscribe over
the last year.

So these people may catch up, I've installed an online archive here:
  http://lurker.slab.org/list/livecode.en.html

the user is toplap and the password is also toplap

New members might want to take a look at the most recent messages which
include some introductions.  Please introduce yourself too, unless
you're shy.

Sorry about the problems with the subscription system!

Best wishes,

alex

I have to say, though; I enjoy "looking at the fingers" (Dutch saying) of a
good DJ.

Generally I like watching anybody make music and I suspect this apeals to
most people. The problem with a lot of electronic performances may not even
be that the way the music is made (mixed/manipulated/whatever) isn't clear.
I've started to believe the issue may be that frequently no music is made a=
t
all. Some performers try to cover this with waving their hands (and so on)
and I suppose that's more apealing then this typical half-hearted state
stuck inbetween changing some paterns and twisting a knob or two and
basically waiting for the pre-aranged hour to pass but I find both leave me
cold.

Millenea of dealing with the social mess that's human culture has made all
of us very good at recognising facial expressions; I don't think there's
much faking possible in a look of intense concentration or enjoyment.
Regardless of projected code; I think actually playing or writing music on
stage will come across quite differently from queing pre-recorded
arrangements. Perhaps a little faith is in order. Indeed; the average
audience member can't be expected to get all the nuances involved in
changing one type of code loop into another but then again; they probably
didn't understand the way a drum machine connected to a analogue synth's
arpegiator the night before either, nor do they need to.

It's pure speculation but I think many of the complaints about laptop
performances are things people later made up in order to cover up a
subconcious realisation that something was wrong and indeed in many cases
something IS wrong.

That doesn't mean projection schreens can't help but to me those add
something akin to puting a camera on the fingers of a guitarist, then
projecting it. Come to think of it; I'd be in favour of projecting the
working space of a DJ as well.

Subject: [livecode] Introduction + question


Hi

I'm new here, so let me introduce myself.

I'm mainly a jazz pianist, but also a keyboard player and linux user. 
The last 3 years almost all my keyboard playing has been with my laptop 
running csound, controlled with 3 usb keyboards.

Over the last year I got increasingly interrested in livecoding, first 
by discovering livenoisetools and mondrian, later by looking at chuck.

Now for an initial question:

I'd like to keep using csound, since I know it very well, and build 
quite a lot of instruments over the years. The last few days I've been 
playing with mondrian together with csound, and some aspects of it work 
quite well. For instance I realy like the idea of expressing melodies in 
relative terms + the ability to put a small motif into a macro, put more 
motif-macros into themes, etc.

However, it seems that mondrian is more geared towards composing, and 
I'm looking for a live oriented tool. Something that'll let me interact 
with it via midi keyboards, and that'll output midi events I can route 
to csound.

Any recomendations for software that'll do that?

Hello list

I'm a SC user, with a background in "paper music" composition.

I don't know if I've ever done livecoding,
though I've evaluated plenty of code live.
I've never wanted to show audience my screen
but have looked with interest, not dancing,
  at others' screens.

ok hello! This list is alive!

Introducing myself, erm...

I use SuperCollider for creating music but I also play guitar, piano  
and at the
moment I am practicing playing the clarinet. I play in few improv- 
bands (with acoustic
or electric instruments) where I use SuperCollider  and I have to  
confess it's
sometimes hard to keep up with the changes in the music, when using  
software.
I see building software environment for fast reactions in a free  
improv situation
as my main challenge these days.

I don't really livecode (as defined by toplap) although I sometimes  
(reluctantly) write
some code while playing live and run it. I prefer not to have to  
write code while
playing live as I find it distracts me from concentrating on the  
music. I am also more
interested in people just closing their eyes listening than watching  
what I am doing.

However, I have always enjoyed "toplappy" performances by people like  
Slub, Nick
Collins, Ge Wang, Dave Griffiths, etc, etc, and I hope to see more of  
them in the future.

My interest in Toplap and this list is based on curiosity but also  
because I use many of the
tools that are relevant here and/or developed by people on the list  
(SC, PD, ChucK, Impromptu).

Related to my interest in Toplap: one of my long term subject of  
fascination is "embodiment"
in music or how we learn playing instruments by incorporating the  
knowledge into our motor
memory ( i.e. learning acoustic instruments, but arguably also  
digital hardware).

I find the act of playing an acoustic instrument and livecoding (as  
defined by Toplap) almost
two opposites of a spectrum. The instrumentalist uses his/her body to  
play the instrument and
often the playing just "happens" without conscious decisions. The  
skill is in the body.
The livecoder however is all in "the mind". The typing on the  
keyboard is just (irritating?)
latency and not an integral part of the playing. Wouldn't the dream  
of the livecoder be to
think the algorithms and plug the thought directly onto projected  
screens without the
intervention of the body?

Livecoding is disembodied music par excellence and that's what I find  
fascinating.

Please disagree, I'd be interested in other views.

---

I also work on a project called ixi ( www.ixi-software.net ) with  
some other people.
The ixi apps are not embodied as such - they are interfaces to  
soundengines that can
be written in SC/PD/ChucK/Max or whatever can communicate using OSC.  
(At the moment
there are only old apps there, but something should happen soon when  
we finally
get our asses together and decide what/how/when to upload the new  
stuff).

---

Cheers
Thor

My introduction to the list.

I've been involved with computer music for some time and a bunch the  
recent activity surrounding this is focused on adaptive music systems  
and is documented, along with some colleagues, here http:// 
adaptivemusic.net/

My live coding activities are done in conjunction with Andrew  
Sorensen and some documentation of our work and Andrew's live coding  
environment called Impromptu are found here http:// 
impromptu.moso.com.au/.

I'm looking forward to continued interesting discussion on this list.

Hey there -

It is providence indeed, Doug- because I have not met many people
busying themselves almost exclusively with the study and
description, in whatever abstract form, of abstract machines.

It began as a book of theory, but now has become a fusion of traditional
storytelling from Rajasthan with whatever a laptop can do better than a
morchang. What I do
is this - I narrate a story in 9 parts of 45 minutes each over several days=
.
It's about
4000 lines of verse, like a hip hop hopera. Each part corresponds to one
abstract
machine that I tried to detail via fantasy and rhythm, with the help of som=
e
friends who are artists. It's called The Jantar Mantar Projekt. I've pasted
a small excerpt from the progue below.

It would be fun to exchange thoughts with you on the subject and learn from
it. Your thesis is going to be very exciting to read!

Hey list,

I'm Till Bovermann and currently working at the Neuroinformatics  
Group, Faculty of Technology, Bielefeld University, Bielefeld,  
Germany (puha...).
link: http://www.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/ags/ni

I'm mainly interested in live sound and graphics coding, esp. in  
conjunction with tangible computing techniques.
I'm also very interested in ambient information displays and/or calm  
arts ( http://http://lfsaw.de/art/theory/index.html )

see my homepage(s) for more details:
     http://LFSaw.de
     http://www.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/~tboverma

For JIT programming (mainly in personal use and for sonification  
developement) I extensively use the JITLib of Julian Rohrhuber (thanx  
for that one!).
At least, currently I hope that I get Io ( http:// 
www.iolanguage.com ) to work in a live coding environment.

for now
cheers
Till Bovermann

Hi all,

I am currently finishing my phd on 'automatic annotation of musical
audio for interactive systems'. The aim of this project is to create
control signals (MIDI, Osc, whatever) from acoustic signals in real
time. A few of these annotation methods, including pitch, onsets, and
tempo, are gathered into a library: http://aubio.piem.org/ (a large
update will be released real soon now).

I have also done some work on packaging supercollider and chuck for
debian, as well as a few other audio packages such as freewheeling and
freecycle. Some of them are available from the debian archives, the
others can be found at http://piem.org/debian/

As you guessed, i am more of a developper than a musician, but i also
sometimes play on computer or piano keyboards :-)

Nice to get in the loop,
Greetings, Piem

Hi all,


I'm composing both instrumental and electronic.

I've used coding on SC 2.2.16 for sound-synthesis and generating
sonic material for my sound-compositions. Also, for
generative sound installations -a subset of  live-programming.

I would like to be involved into dynamic programming
as I see it as an interesting path into live-performances.


Bests,

All,

I'd like to introduce myself to the list.

Geographically, I am from Buffalo, New York, USA.

Musically, I am a bass player, focused primarily on Jazz. 

Technically, I have my degree in Computer Science, and I'm an avid Perl
hacker. I work during the day as a network/systems administrator.

Currently, I am working on a framework that will allow me to
dynamically create Jazz music using Perl and ChucK. Previously, I was
using SuperCollider and Alex's feedback.pl script. I did a presentation
last night at a Buffalo Perl Mongers meeting, and talked about live
coding and creating algorithmic music using Perl.

Hi Till

nice to stumble upon you here.

I followed the link and this looks really impressing. I like Python  
and am a big fan of
Ruby, but how does the iolanguage feel? The comparison with those two  
languages
are quite favorable.

And how does it compare to SuperCollider, being both based on Smalltalk?

Could you report a little?

Cheers

hello Livecoders

High time to introduce myself lest I drift into the obscurity of lurkers.

I'm a composer who also makes video art, mostly=20
for theater and dance but I also do a lot of=20
autonomous work. I've also acted and danced in=20
some small stage productions, and I make=20
installation art and write software too. And in=20
the little time left over I teach music=20
technology and composition at the Utrecht School=20
of Music Technology. If you want you can read all=20
about me at http://www.LowNorth.nl/marcel/ (allow=20
me to apologize in advance for the cheesy=20
picture).

So that all the purists can dismiss me=20
immediately: I do live coding with MaxMSP.

My approach to live coding is a little less=20
technical than it is conceptual. I'm a big fan of=20
the early surrealists, and my goal is to apply=20
the idea of "=E9criture automatique" to live=20
coding. For the (few) performances I've done with=20
my students we set a time limit - 5 minutes -=20
within which the performer has to put together a=20
generative patch.
A small Max patch running in the background=20
crashes the computer after exactly 5 minutes of=20
coding. This not only heightens the level of=20
stress the performer experiences, resulting in a=20
more invigorating experience for everybody, but=20
it also ensures that the performer's work can't=20
be saved, reflecting the transient (volatile?)=20
nature of the medium.

Anyone living in the Netherlands is of course welcome to see us perform:

This is great (especially the auto computer crash, reminds me of Alex's 
stage management techniques), I look forward to seeing a performance at 
some point.

I don't think there is a massive objection to Max per se, it's just 
probably not so powerful/convenient a programming language, but of course 
it is well suited to audio and has some built in audience accessibility.

I do wonder how much extra stress we could all take. Perhaps professional 
hecklers could be brought to live coding gigs, or hackers be allowed to 
disrupt a performer's system during a performance in efforts to shake them 
from their all consuming purpose...

I'd like to know more about "Alex's stage management techniques".

I recently built an automatic stage manager for=20
an interactive music/image/interactive hypertable=20
concert thingy I do with the group "8=3D8".

cf. http://www.abstractmachine.net/blog/?p=3D12

We called the program "Big_Daddy" because it runs=20
the show, not us -- the performers. It even=20
determines the start of the show, meaning that=20
performances start *on time*, down to the second.=20
It really is pleasant, and keeps things moving,=20
to have a program determining the order of the=20
sets and their lengths -- and not the lead=20
guitarist...

The question often with automatic conductors, is=20
how does the audience know about it? My collegues=20
from the group "PacJap" created a simple but=20
ingenious system that had a picture of each=20
participant in a big networked stream/mix/osc=20
whatever -- whenever someone contributed to the=20
flux, their picture lit up, or changed. Suddenly=20
you could understand who was doing what in the=20
performance.

A few years ago I collaborated on a headphone festival in london as part
of the international "placard headphone festival."  We'd got a bit over
excited and invited loads of people to play which meant that there was
only room for 20 minutes each over 14 hours.  So I built a robot, a
bunch of relays attached to a parallel port:
http://state51org.static3.state51.co.uk/62/95/0070054_llSv/original.jpeg

then wrote some software that switched between the performers at the
right moment.  The idea was to have four inputs, where one input was
live and playing, two had performers setting up, and the final one had
someone who just played taking their stuff away.  A projection told the
performers when and where to set up, and ticked down to switch-on time.

I nearly chickened out at the last moment but in the end it worked like
a charm.  It broke the next year though so last year I bought a more
professional USB controller to do the switching.

We used a similar system at the runme/dorkbot citycamp, a conference
which would otherwise have had too many participants.

Really nice to know of others doing similar things, maybe we should make
another organisation for automatic conductors :)

James,

Don't know what sort of problems you're having with SC3 on Windows, but
I'm using a combination of SC3-Complete [1] to run a Win32 server, with
CoLinux [2] to run the language in a virtual linux machine.

It's not ideal (some timing issues and no GUI of course) but it does
make a noise!  If you have any other ideas I wouldn't mind hearing them
offlist.

Cheers

Yeah, definitely, but... I havn't seen a proper environment for doing  
so...
something like the language frontend as seen at SuperCollider would  
fit nice...
Also there is currently no OSC communication possible...

Subject: [livecode] chuck + miniAudicle + audicle update


Fellow live coders,

Given all the new members (and it's been a while since many of the
older members got together), I would like to give a status update /
introduction on ChucK + miniAudicle + Audicle development.

Firstly, in case you missed the link, here is the ToplapSystems page,
which links to many of the languages and systems for live coding:

     http://www.toplap.org/index.php/ToplapSystems

ChucK is but one way to do on-the-fly programming, though it has its own
unique way of thinking and quirks.  It is open source and fully supported
on OSX, Linux, and Windows.  The language provides a concurrent
programming model based on time, and allows one to do on-the-fly
programming via these mechanisms (the unified time-based mechanism
provides a flexible and precise way to synthesize sound and create
music "together").

     http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/

If you last used ChucK in its early days (before late 2005), much has
changed since.  v2 was released in August 2005, finally supporting
objects/inheritance, arrays, stereo, events, OSC, and much better
documentation.  Since then, we have added many more features, including
multi-channel audio, HID support, new UGen's and new language features.
Development is continuing rapidly (several full-time developers, plus more
than a dozen part-time contributors).  Documentation can found here:

     http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/doc/

Traditionally, ChucK has been a command line program (like java, gcc,
perl) on Linux/OSX/Windows.  Now, it's also possible to use a integrated
environment called the miniAudicle (so far only released on OS X), which
is another way to code chuck on-the-fly:

     http://audicle.cs.princeton.edu/mini/

Finally, there is the Audicle, which is meant to be a graphical
programming environment for writing ChucK code.  Implemented in OpenGL
(also cross-platform, but in pre-pre-alpha), the Audicle intends to
be an interface and a program monitor for live coding and at once,
provides insight both to the programmer and to the audience:

     http://audicle.cs.princeton.edu/

We have also been using ChucK to teaching for performance in the Princeton
Laptop Orchestra:

     http://plork.cs.princeton.edu/

Some audiovisuals:

ICMC 2004 presentation:
     http://soundlab.cs.princeton.edu/listen/audicle_icmc2004.mov

"On-the-fly Counterpoint (2005)" with Perry Cook:
     http://soundlab.cs.princeton.edu/listen/otfc2005x.mp3

"Non-Specific Gamelan Taiko Fusion" with Perry Cook
(for 15 computers + humans, synchronized):
     http://plork.cs.princeton.edu/video/nonspecific.mov

"Assignment 2: make a drum machine, perform it on-the-fly"
(PLOrk freshman seminar, 2005)
     http://plork.cs.princeton.edu/video/plork_drum.mov

If you are still reading, and interested (and haven't used ChucK
recently), I encourage you to give the more recent chuck/miniAudicle a
try.  If you are interested in at least keeping an eye on the progress,
there is the 'chuck' mailing list:

     http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/community/

Thanks and sorry.  Feel free to email us if you have any questions or to
call us idiots, etc.

Best wishes,
Ge!

Subject: [livecode] livecode -> midi


Hi

After a lot of introductions, I figured my questions maybe got lost in 
my own introduction. So I'll try again:

I'd like to know if anyone knows of software that'll allow at least some 
of the things livecoding is about, with output send to midi? I know most 
apps have some kind of midi out possibilities, but I'm looking for 
something more directly geared towards this.

The reason is I made a large number of midi enabled csound instruments 
that I use heavily live. Currently I'm "just" playing them from my usb 
keyboards in band settings, but I'd like to supplement that with some 
kind of livecoding ability, esp algorithmic approaches interrests me.

I looked at Mondrian 
(http://www.math.tu-berlin.de/~brinkman/software/mondrian/index.html) 
but it lacks a few features to be truely valuable in livecoding situations.

I run linux/debian/stable.

SuperCollider and ChucK both have MIDI capabilities.

Also, I think both Quoth (Craig Latta) and fluxus/noisepattern (Dave=20
Griffiths) use MIDI out to software synths.

perhaps explore the ToplapSystems page too.

I think Mondrian has a lot of potential, it uses a more traditional and

The thing is, I've never been sure if this counts as livecoding or not, a=

string replacement to do arithmetic (see Douglas Hofstadter's "Godel,

Me neither...
But I've seen that it should be easy to include native (c++) code as  
a primitive...
why not using oscpack?

sounds interesting, but could we find something which runs natively  
on osx?
I think the gtk+ osx port is still not available in a working version...

But you have the growing thing going, right?

Right... Maybe I'm not a livecoder after all :-)

And moreover, being a jazzpianist with classical training (even studied 
counterpoint for 2 years) I really like the way you can work with motivs 
building them into themes, sequencing (that is repeating the same melody 
from another scale degree) etc.. I find it a very musical way of working.

I'll look into that, thanks. As Dave already mentioned (and explained me 
a while back in private email) noisepattern works with OSC...

in the l system sense yes, rules can contain references to themselves and
each other, so depending on the number of generations you set, things can
get complex.

I used to have a genetic interface to generate or mutate these rules, but
I've stopped using that which forces me to manually play/code it more,
which is a lot more effort, but feels better for the moment.

absolutely, I don't have a musical background at all
(painter->animator->programmer) - and I find that this way of working
allows me to create music in a way I understand.

also something that was pointed out to me recently after a gig was that
it, (and livecoding in a wider sense) allows you to make sweeping changes
very quickly - the whole thing is very malleable.

of course this means it's easy to ruin everything with just as few
keypresses, which I also do often :)

actually, I think this is very much about livecoding if you work more lik=
e
this, I've started to use scheme to store and manipulate bits of melody
between sequences in the way you describe:

; a core motif
(define motif "o.---o.++++++o.---o.")

; use the motif to build some sequences using the lsystem generator - 3 i=
s
; the number of generations, and "!1" is the axiom, the rules replace the
; first string with the second...
(define sequence1 (lsys-gen 3 "!1" (list (cons "1" "21") (cons "2" motif)=
)))
(define sequence2 (lsys-gen 3 "!1" (list (cons "1" "2+++1---2") (cons "2"
motif))))

; make 2 parts with sequence1, the second one offset by 3 (to form rounds=
),
; and and other with sequence 2
(pattern 1 1 sequence1)
(pattern 2 1 (string-append "..." sequence1))
(pattern 3 1 sequence2)

this way you can change "motif" and the whole piece changes.

	Yes, I use Quoth[1] with both internal and external MIDI devices. It's 
written with Squeak Smalltalk[2], another system which seems perfectly 
suited to livecoding (because of its dynamism and reflection). Quoth 
makes extensive use of runtime code generation (English-to-Smalltalk) 
and context manipulation (a la continuations and exceptions).

	There's an OSC package available for Squeak, as I recall.

	For those in the San Francisco Bay Area, I'm giving a presentation 
about Quoth at the monthly SF Dorkbot[3] meeting tomorrow (oops, sorry 
for the short notice).

	I plan to give it away, but have yet to make a release. I'm changing a 
bunch of things at the moment[*]. I plan to make a release within a week 
of my Dorkbot presentation tomorrow.


	thanks!

[*]

	I finally figured out how to teach new phrases to items using only 
English (the first version involved occasionally switching to a 
Smalltalk environment to program new words). So now I feel like it's a 
full livecoding environment from the audience's point of view. There was 
always livecoding going on, in the form of compiling and running 
everything the player says, but that was pretty subtle and limited to 
things like simple assignment, as in the movie. Non-trivial algorithms 
weren't really possible without Smalltalk programming.

	The movie never showed what happened when you said something that an 
item didn't understand. Now the system does something quite strange and 
useful. :)

	And of course I have another project that has delayed things. :)  Spoon 
( http://netjam.org/spoon ) is my attempt at better system organization 
and application delivery for Smalltalk, and I'd intended to make Quoth 
the first thing I released for it. I expect to get that out this year, 
but I should make a preliminary release of Quoth in the meantime.

This would mean that I could try it out in about a week or so? I assume 
you will announce it's release here, right?

	Oh yes, and probably nowhere else. ;)  It still has many rough edges,

Hello everyone,

Sorry it's taken me so long to get around to my introduction. Things  
are pretty busy for me at the moment since the end of the semester is  
approaching.

I'm Mark Egli and I'm currently working on a Computer Engineering BS  
degree at the University of Illinois.

I'm not livecoding because my forays into programming thus far have  
been rather limited and I find the list of Toplap Systems to be  
rather daunting. Nonetheless, I have more than a passing interest in  
algorithmic composition so I'm here the glean as much information as  
possible. I'm also interested in trying to pick up knowledge along  
these lines in an academic setting, but I haven't been able to find  
much available here at the U of I. If anyone wants to make a pitch  
for their college/university, I might be looking at grad school  
options sooner than I'd like to think about.

Hi all,

time to say hello from Graz/Austria. I don't know if PureData (and other 
patcher languages) do suffice the toplap manifesto, but we are happy 
using pd in a performance called "blind date" where we approach the live 
coding/audience challenge by using two computers, one making audio, the 
other video/3D. Both screens with the patches are displayed as well.
We take live-coding to another level by letting two people work on the 
same box, using two sets of mice, keyboards and monitors, to allow 
collaborative patching where one has to allow the other to program as 
well,plus making changes to what your partner has already done on screen.
In the recent version of this performance setup, more people than 
computers were available, so we would make a change every 5 minutes, 
resulting in the player sitting in front of a fresh patch, unknown so 
far to himself, struggling with the way to add/modify it.
We see this as a quite promising way to do live-coding, collaborative 
patching, and audience interaction at the same time.

happy to see this list coming up!

regards,

Peter

Call for PAPERS, PRESENTATIONS AND PERFORMANCES

(re)ACTOR: THE FIRST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DIGITAL LIVE ART
September 11, 2006
The Octagon @ Queen Mary, University of London
London, England, UK

Deadline for 2-page submissions 26 May 2006
http://www.digitalliveart.co.uk

In cooperation with HCI 2006: ENGAGE
The 20th British HCI Group conference in co-operation with ACM


*******************************************************************

DIGITAL LIVE ART is the intersection of human-computer interaction
(HCI), live art and computing. This conference seeks to bring together
practitioners and academics from the varying worlds of live art,
computing and human-computer interaction for a lively debate and event
which will explore this emerging field. Our specific context focuses on
club cultures as a living context for digital live arts practices. Our
expected outcomes are to create a community of digital live artists and
to present strategies for designing, developing and evaluating Digital
Live Art. Such an event provides an opportunity to open up conversations
between digital art and live performance and will allow us to explore
how it is used to increase our understanding of human-computer
interaction in general.

The notion of Digital Live Art is that of a hybrid art form which
focuses on presence and presupposes the digital as a way of making live
engagements. Our particular interest is in exploring the relationship
that develops between performers, participants and observers within
playful contexts and how Digital Live Art may move people to
performative interaction and communal engagement.

THE CONFERENCE
The conference will include both daytime presentations and an evening
ambient after party. The daytime event will include a keynote panel with
Charles Kriel, Philip Auslander, and Jon Dovey. Kriel
http://www.kriel.tv/djvjinfo is broadly regarded as one of the world's
leading VJs. He VJs regularly for the likes of Pete Tong, Fatboy Slim,
DJ Tiesto, Darren Emerson and Sasha and was recently appointed a Senior
Lecturer at London Metropolitan University. His pioneering work includes
the world's first nationally telecast VJ mix to the UK. Auslander
http://www.lcc.gatech.edu/~auslander/ has written on aesthetic and
cultural performances as diverse as theatre, performance art, music,
stand-up comedy, and courtroom procedures and is the author of four
books and editor or co-editor of two collections, his most current
Performing Glam Rock: Gender and Theatricality in Popular Music. Dovey
http://www.republicof.net/ spent the first 15 years of his working life
in video production, working through the early years of Channel Four as
a researcher, editor and eventually as Producer. He worked principally
in documentary and experimental video, co founding original scratch
artists Gorilla Tapes in 1984. His video projects gained international
distribution and recognition and have now taken their place in the
documented histories of UK Video Art. His forthcoming book is titled
Game Cultures.

The schedule includes peer-reviewed paper presentations, interactive
installations and performances, a cross-disciplinary discussion forum
and an ambient after-party. The conference and evening event will take
place in the Octagon at Queen Mary, University London - the recently
refurbished library which was originally built in 1888 and was modeled
on the Reading Room of the British Library (now the British Museum) and
was formerly contained within the famous East End People's Palace.

Subject: [livecode] LiveCoda


Here is an interesting notice of an Australian live coding competition:

http://www.esci.org/

I like the way programming is separated from music, and will be accompanied 
by musicians; let's hope no programmer exceeds the remit of the contest and 
maps the input data to the auditory domain ; )

yes this is really a new genre in live coding - maybe it could be 
staged even more dramatically: orchestra in the orchestra pit, a team 
of professional typists on the left side of the stage, a team of 
computer scientists on center stage and a team of mathematicians on 
the right. The piece could be called "The Goldbach Conjecture".

Subject: [livecode] cybersonica on may 19th/20th
From: alex <alex
Date: Sat, 13 May 2006 20:39:41 +0100



I was asked to make a panel for cybersonica in london and it's turned
into a TOPLAP panel; Amy, Nick and (so far not toplap affiliated but
livecoders) martin+jonni from ap/1010.

http://cybersonica.org/

The original plan was not to do something directly about livecoding but
that's what it's turned into.  Everything comes back to livecoding in
the end.

It's on Saturday 20th May from 11:30am until 1:30pm. 

Also we've got 40 mins worth of performance on 19th May.  There isn't a
fixed plan for what to do with that.  If anyone is around and wants to
join in some kind of jam please do, it might be fun to not use the
projectors and just have people dotted around so people can see the
screens, hub style.  Or maybe use the screens for the more visual stuff
(amy? dave?).  Anyway let me know if you're up for it and I'll work
something out.

Also, not livecoding related, but Amy is co-presenting her SVEN project
at dorkbotlondon at space studios in hackney on Wednesday the 24th.

Cheers,

alex

Subject: [livecode] livecoding with a gamepad
From: "Dave Griffiths" <dave


is the plan:
http://www.pawfal.org/index.php?page=3DClickCode

Very work in progress, but I'd like to make something that is easy to
write self modifying code live. the screenshot is the contents of memory
after a process has copied itself a few times, and wrapped around the 256
bytes of memory. It makes a lot more sense to see it in action, rather
than a snapshot.

orange =3D byte interpreted as an opcode
blue =3D byte used as data
red =3D byte being read from
yellow =3D byte being written to

It's sort of based on this: http://www.pawfal.org/Art/Quagmire/ but the
memory display will also be a simple IDE for the microcode, controllable
via ganepad/dance mat/joystick input :)

cheers,

Might be alright as a performer, hopefully you don't have to do a long 
proposal- on the academic side, I don't have time to do a 2 page proposal, 
and since they have `early registration' of course this conference is 
`pay-to-speak' (I know this is standard academic practice, but just warning 
any non-academics on this list who might consider it). Might be interesting 
to attend if Joe Paradiso from MIT is speaking (he is on the reading 
committee)...

Hi all,

We're organising a dorkbot camp near Dorking (near London) on the
weekend of September 1st.  Among other events there'll be headphone
performances in beautiful surroundings.  It would be great to have a
TOPLAP workshop/meeting during the camp.

More info here: http://burningdork.slab.org/

So, who's up for it?

From: Amy Alexander <amy
Subject: Re: [livecode] livecoding with a gamepad


groovy! actually Thingee also offers a gamepad interface to livecoding.... 
but not the same kind... the
 idea being that when you livecode a snippet of code that you like, and you 
want to be able to reuse that snippet of code later in the performance
without remembering/retyping it, you can hit a key on the keyboard that  
will assign it to a button on the gamepad. then any time you hit that 
button, it pastes in the code (in Thingee's case, into the visuals...)  
then when you are ready to execute it, you add the semi-colon (which 
always is the cue for Thingee to execute something.) 

might seem trivial, but the idea is to decouple livecoding from the 
necessity of typing, thus helping with problems of lack of gesture, typing 
virtuosity, or even mechanics of coding virtuosity...

 http://deprogramming.us/perfs/

btw, i recently added some modificiations to Thingee including a 
"blackout" command for better group performance... must remember to upload 
it; the old version is still online, oof...

Hi Amy,

I was going to ask about the Thingee dance mat actually, I assume it has
a similar function? Dancing code has to be a holy grail of performance
programming :)

I'm hoping to have a similar code pasting function in this virtual
machine idea - so you can save bits of memory (data=code) and paste them
back in.

As for decoupling the typing interface, a game pad with analogue sticks
allows you to use a circle menu for selecting individual instructions -
which may be lot easier - memorising directions rather than key
combinations. 

Not sure how easy any of it is going to be yet though, had the whole
virtual machine and interface written in scheme running in fluxus, but
the timing is too shoddy for the audio so I'm having to rewrite the vm
in C++ now.

Dear Douglas -

I'm curious to know how (and if) your concept of "abstract machines"
corresponds with my own. I started out by imagining that a hurricane
could be seen as a thermodynamical motor, but that wouldn't really
make it an "abstract machine" in the Delezean sense. Then I found
a link with ancient Vedic-Hindu yantras
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yantras)
which are basically fractal/symmetry structures
that one is supposed to stare at (a form of meditation).

I understand that converting gaming modules into Universal
Turing Machines (or simple sequencers, for that matter) is the
next big wave in performance art, but you see - there are still
elements here which are not abstract.

So for me the abstract machine should be a machine that the
performer "imagines' in front of him, and then uses manipulations
and livecoding of that imaginary machine to create an auditory
experience.

Are you pondering what I am pondering, Brain?

I don't completely agree, quite on the contrary,

Yes, but I think Live-Coding is a theme in which
other areas are automatically brought in. How
healthy.

To be honest, I can't think of any area of science
that cannot be sucked in by livecoding....

yes, outside of live-coding itself, which does not really
exist, because think + type + compile + run is a not real time
sport, really.  often i think, it might be better to term it
a new form interfacing.

The question is if we want to see the techniques of live coding to be 
more than something that happens within a specific cultural context 
and situation (electronic music on stage).

As far as my research is concerned, I can only state that the notion 
of an abstract machine and its pecularities are very much connected 
to it forming a relation between process and text. Threfore formal 
interaction with a running process is of general interest both in art 
and science.

A question that regularly comes up in this context is the role of 
language in interaction - the rubic's cube, as you have alluded to 
structuralism, comes close to something like a semiotic machine, a 
code; other interfaces maybe less. I'd find it interesting to discuss 
here in what way live coding (or interactive programming) is tied to 
a language/text and how this relates to other "interfaces".

Yes, but we all know that Hesse did 3 things we can never forgive:

1. Enslaved Hugo Ball as his secretary.

2. Rejected any form of non tonal music.

3. Found India repulsive.

Now, does laptop music have to stay in the dance hall?

Interfacing is slightly problematic, as it is full of assumptions 
that live coding tries to weaken (talking about environments is a 
good way to avoid this I think). I tend to use the term interactive 
programming as the non-stage artistic or scientific paradigm.

Nice :)

Most Indians also find India repulsive, but some

Heh! You're right, the open spaces of the world should

I understand that TOPLAP has already been strongly criticised for its
preoccupation with this context.  The recent panel at the Dana centre
included ap (www.1010.co.uk), who (again, as I understand it) are
rejecting that situation and (by association) TOPLAP.  This is a shame
as the members of TOPLAP make up a very broad church, Julian in
particular has often flagged up this issue.  Anyway I should invite ap
to this list so they can make their position for themselves.

By the way, Martin of ap livecoded the panel session in lisp which
involved speech synthesis and quite a bit of debugging.  They introduced
their notion of 'expanded software' which I didn't fully understand but
involved interactively programming everything.

Nick -

I know the relevant portions from GBG,
and I think the most important link
that Hesse made was with I Ching,
a Chinese system of divination.
I have been studying this for some
time now.

your archive message seems like a bibliography
or list of something. i couldn't understand it

He was the programmer who wrote the various programs
based on the Coin Method. These were then used by
John Cage. It is in a way  truly live coding as it could be used on
stage to make decisions. i.e. Variations III, IV on the fly.

they didn't fully understand it either ; )

ap wanted to twist `live coding' to be `alive coding', alive in the 
environment. Their world is basically a world of software art.

live coding does sound like concert realtime programming, so `interactive 
programming' is a wider term. TOPLAP doesn't have to restrict itself to 
concerts, though this is what I (personally) find most artistically 
interesting. From a utility/prototyping perspective, interpreted 
programming languages are great, but I don't feel any need to explore that 
for art. It is the sheer challenge of trying to code anything interesting 
whatsoever in front of an audience, those realtime constraints on thinking 
that show some analogy to other forms of improvisation. But maybe that's 
just me ; )

Just to be clear, Julian, we did try to mention your point of view at the 
panel as well. It was a shame you couldn't make it over, but I think ap 
being there gave another alternative opinion. And ap didn't mean to do any 
coding in front of us on their presentation creator software- it just 
didn't run when they tried it, so they had to debug. They didn't modify it 
while it was working either.

ap seem like they set things up and leave them in a (non-social) 
environment- ie, their desert code piece, which evolves based on 
environmental sensors in California. In many ways though, social human 
situations are the ultimate challenge. The livecode take allows us to leave 
an active human presence somewhere amongst the code, a social agent.

In a classical music performance, the known language is
the seven basic notes and this is known to the most audiences
who appreciate classical music.

If you're using Perl for Toplapping, the music produced (and the
screen displayed) will only be of interest to those who have had a
brush with Perl.

TopLapping will never get close to a real performance until the "interpreted
language"
being TopLapped is also evolved live in front of the audience. There must be
NO USE
OF ARTIFICAL MEMORY FOR PROCESSING SOUND. That's the GBG perspective anyway.


This is why the I Ching is important in this context. As a live programming
interface.

hang on, the coin method here is just an algorithm. Was the algorithm 
itself modified on stage by Cage/Culver/Hiller?

As I usually argue, though I might be misguided, running a pre-specified 
algorithm is not live coding, since the content is predetermined (even is 
the numbers that come up are not necessarily predictable by a human 
operative). We need human action somewhere upon a running program.

I disagree, the Perl can generating the same seven notes.  Violin
strings and Perl $strings can be very different interfaces for much the
same thing.

Any audience is probably more interested in the beer they're drinking
and the conversation they're having than the Perl.

i think you might be referring to notation rather than music here -

We disagree because I do not know Perl, and you perform
with it. Alex - I'm trying to imagine that when we are typing
on a laptop - its a bit like percussion, if you hear the sound
of the keys. That can be seen and interpreted by the audience,
and it falls in with the waves of music you are producing. It
makes sense to their apparatus. BECAUSE Perl cause
a cognitive dissonance between your hand-actions and
the music, there is a problem.

Then they shouldn't come to a concert hall. It is true for most bar
and club performances though, if that is TopLap's destiny.

It's a gross simplification, I admit.

Is there a problem when someone presses a small key and a huge sound
comes out?  I hope some correlation can be seen between for example
frantic typing and frantic results, that would seem enough to me.  But
really I think it's up to an audience to get what they want out of a
performance, they're paying for it so they should have some freedom.

I understand that the requirement to be silent and fully attentive in a
concert hall is only recent (c.f. Christopher Small - Musicking).

I see TOPLAP as a looser group of people, who don't make their music in
particular or prescribed ways (manifestos should not be taken too
seriously), but have similarities in some part of their method.

I think we should start by looking for similarities between activities,
before we look for differences.  Otherwise we will fall into making
false claims for novelty, miss the opportunity to draw on
cross-disciplinary knowledge, and fail to understand the more
novel/interesting aspects of the activities.

The whole issue (which I do find interesting) focuses around the 
question of what "life" (not live!) is - historically generative art 
goes back to artificial life, so it inherits a lot from this 
discourse. As far as I can see, live coding seems to inherit more 
from dada/lettrism, formalism and concept art.

great to have such an illustration !

I have a suggestion:

conventional programming

problem -> problem formulation -(alg./data[1])-> implementation -> 
solution (feeds back to [1])

interactive programming

problem[1] -> problem formulation(feeds back to [1]) 
-(alg./data[1])-> implementation -> solution (feeds back to [1])


I think it is the right method when the problem is not clear in 
advance or depends critcally on the way it is expressed (typical 
situations would be good to collect). If the problem can be formally 
expressed clearly, then I'd rather try to go with Djikstra who held 
that a good language should basically be able to implement the 
abstract formula directly.

Hi,

I wanted to clarify our panel position in regard to live
coding/TOPLAP; it's possibly not as extreme as Alex suggests - we
wanted to make a transition from live coding as technique (which can
be critiqued when focused on as technique with arguments such as the
return of the virtuosic or code/guitar solo), into what we could now
term life coding (or as i see in another thread from Julian - alive
coding) - with the equal overarching question of what is life (a
machinery for living calling up vast 20C questions of economies) or
for that matter code - questions entertained using the descriptive
means which can be agreed upon as software. I think that could begin a
definition of life coding which I don't think denies or rejects TOPLAP
- perhaps it needed to be made plainer that TOPLAP embraces a wider
calling (?) than the technical use of moderate to high level coding
within contemporary languages in a determined cultural context. And
yes the social. That's what we were trying to do with plenum at
limehouse. Life coding is online in note form at:

http://www.1010.co.uk/life_coding.html

I'm trying to work up as an introduction to our xxxxx_reader
(published in association with Mute mid July) the topic of life coding
in relation to framing, Pynchon, mechanism and the kitchen sink and
can post progress if there's interest. At the same time we're
programming (in the old sense) an xxxxx seminar module for piksel
(norway) in mid-october attempting to interface this and the xxxxx
thematics with a discussion of open hardware. Any presentation
proposals would be great!

just an observation for what it's worth:
although I didn't see the presentation, what you call the 'return of the
virtuosic' does not preclude the social. for instance, you could look at
paolo virno's writing for a discussion of how virtuosity and performance are
close to politics. virno is interested in performance/communication without
a script, or rather, with a script that is dynamic. this seems to work well
in relation to live-coding, to my mind at least.

The trouble I have with what you're saying is that it's too rational. And it
is not
the artist's job to be rational.

I don't think we should look for similarities at all. I think we should
create
differences and be comfortable with them - with arguments, instead of meek
camaraderie and patpatpat/laplaplap.

That whole smugness about what one artist is doing causes
the atrophy of any artform.  We should really be kicking and shouting
and cracking bad jokes here if TopLap is to get anywhere.
Dig what I'm saying?
Loose is good.

In my view there are a couple of assumptions here that cause the confusion.

* the separation between stage and audience
* the separation between artist/non-artist or consumer/producer
* the separation between rational/irrational
* the separation between art and science

Since the 20th century (at the latest) artistic activity usually has 
been to try to work beyond these categories (and find new ones).

To just jump in here a minute - I think I'm increasingly interested in
craft - and in relation to programming I think it's much more suited
thinking about it that way. The act of making something by hand - and
presenting code as not an ethereal abstract formula, but something made b=
y
human hands. I think Amy started me thinking like this - it exposes code
as a thoroughly human thing (and that (computer) languages are utterly
designed for humans, not computers).

I don't think it's surprising that livecoding performances are interestin=
g
to an audience - people simply enjoy seeing things being made. And this,
bound up with the resulting music/visuals/smells is more important than
how closely it equates to a traditional music performance.

What I'm interested is a computing language other than mathematics
that allows human beings to "compute" any number
of abstract transformations. And this computation would
happen with the help of vocal sounds. That would surely
close the gap betwen music and spoken language.

Do you think this gap was closer or non-existant in the past?

I like this perspective a lot.

I remember reading how in some (Australian aboriginal) societies the
culture is passed on as songs and stories told during, and as part of the
painting of pictures or making of artifacts - all bound into the same
knowledge. The process *is* knowledge, story, music etc.

It's always going to be easy to trick a computer to reveal their
identity as such until the computer has full sensory apparatus.

Turing proposals were complex, where the test subject should be asked
whether their counterpart was male or female, rather than human or
computer.  You count how often the subject guesses right, and then see
if they score the same if you replace the male with a computer program.

See section one of the paper:
http://loebner.net/Prizef/TuringArticle.html

Also, it seems unfair to grade software on their human-like behaviour
without also grading people on their human-like behaviour.  I'm not sure
how well I'd do at that.  Maybe we should be testing each other for
computer like behaviour :)

thanks! :)

we've talked in the past about the smoke and mirrors aspect of (computer)
art, but I'm really motivated by livecoding because it shows/is all the
working parts (no explanations required), and the idea of treating the
audience like an equal rather than a consumer. I think in some way free
software is an part of that too.

yup, fluxus as code interface/graphics, some of these for audio:
http://www.pawfal.org/Software/livenoisetools/ and a load of scheme code
to glue it all together.

I was thinking about the comments - in wired/slashdot etc, it is always a
concept that seems to make a certain percentage of people angry.

for what I can see, the article to some degree but even more the 
comments show that the fact that it is about writing music, and not 
about tools and that it is an art performance genre. But it is very 
good to have a reaction at all..

It's a shame the anger isn't directed at the tabloid journalism that
generates these sorts of stories. The article is full of inaccuracies,
misrepresentations and is, at best, one person's glossy intepretation of
something more substantial than the populist agenda it is pushing. I
suspect if the general Wired readership were aware of this such comments
wouldn't be so strong.

Really... "traded in his guitar when he found he could be more creative 
with code than with strings". Typical tabloidism.

One of the great things about TOPLAP is that we can respond to this sort
of misrepresentation through ironic reflection. Our manifesto is
intentionally tongue-in-cheek to do exactly this. The same could be said
of our non-commital acronym. These are weapons we should be using to
destroy the narrowminded casting of populist media. It's not like we 
_need_ the acceptance of Wired's readership.

I think we should form a TOPLAP Certification and Award scheme. 
Certificates could be issued authoritatively to livecoding software to 
reinforce the fact that livecoding is a thoroughly serious and important 
facet of modern performance. Software producers would be able to apply for 
permission to TOPLAP to include the certification logo on software to show 
their compliance. Individuals could be rewarded to show how committed they 
are to the livecoding cause. It would be thoroughly important, and include 
lots of handwaving and backslapping. We'd write press releases, and 
everything.

Any thoughts?

Sometimes I feel like the response assumes that the current work is
the end product and they can not see where it is heading. Or perhaps
can not realise the more subtle importance of the work (especially in
such brief news articles). Makes my job fun because I can always aim
for that "end product told-you-so" gig. :)

Sorry to reply to my own message but I'm getting increasingly interested
in this.  I'm sure we've all customised our programming environments to
some extent.  I mean my environment is the Perl programming language,
provided by far cleverer people than myself, but through making music
with it I've built up a library of code that to some extent defines the
style of music I make, making it easier to not only make that style of
music, but also understand, reason about and change it.

Also, these libraries of code that we build up, the starting points and
"pre-prepared scripts."  Maybe we should think of this more as long term
memory.  If so, then going through these old scripts is analogous to
dreaming.  By finding common patterns running through old scripts we can
dream up new syntax and semantics that make the patterns more explicitly
expressible.

Lastly, I'm finding this chapter really interesting, it contains a model
of improvisation which seems readily applicable to livecoding:

yes it seems that the way how a piece of code reperesents a certain 
sound is very important for what kind of intervention is possible or 
thinkable. In the end this is just a very specific kind of balance 
between hiding and showing. In a way each word used in a language is 
a little specialty with its own history, so the idea of "opening it 
all up entirely" is not really what we are after (while sometimes a 
voyage into the unfolding of meaning can be quite valuable). I 
suspect what limits this little language approach a little is that a 
program text is kind of a public dream between people - so we need to 
lern each other's little languages.

>Lastly, I'm finding this chapter really interesting, it contains a model

looks interesting. I'll have a look at it.

My knowledge of music is pretty limited, but I think Jazz "standards"  
might possibly be a useful comparison. Something you (and the other  
musicians you are performing with) can start from, return to, and  
generally improvise around without having to start from scratch.

I'm sure some people might see using libraries as less "live", but if  
the libraries consist of discoveries and experience from live coding  
then they still represent live code, code written live, and will help  
more and more complex live code to be written. In a way it is just a  
single program (or system) being written over a number of  
performances rather than starting from scratch each time. So tour- 
orientated coding rather than gig-oriented coding.

The long term memory comparison is a good one. Treating performance  
as exploratory coding on top of existing achievements, finding  
(design) patterns and robustifying them as part of a library is also  
comparable to developing a musical style or a canon, concretised in  
code. Possibly the library is a kind of score, but a very  
indeterminate and unstable one.

The DIGITAL ART WEEKS program is concerned with the application of  
digital technology in the arts.
Consisting of symposium, workshops and performances, the Digital Art  
Weeks program offers insight
into current research and innovations in art and technology as well  
as illustrating resulting synergies
in a series of performances during the Digital Art Weeks Festival  
each year, making artists aware of
impulses in technology and scientists aware of the possibilities of  
application of technology in the arts.

Topics this year for PAPERS, DEMONSTRATIONS and PERFORMANCES include:

Media Enhanced Artwork in the areas of Performance, Dance and Sound-Art
Laptop Music (including Live-Coding!) & Film Accompaniment (Live- 
Cinema & Live-Re-Scoring)
Mobile Art & Music Works that explore Performer Networking and  
Audience Participation
Net-poetry and literature & computer mediated communication (i.e.  
Hyper-Media Embedding)
Grammar-based Software Systems for Multimedia

Topics this year for PANELS concerning in relationship to the  
Performative Surround include:

Software Innovations relevant to all aspects of Computer Mediated  
Communication and its application in the performing arts
Live Cinema, Expanded Video, Film Rescoring & Immersive Audio Space &  
Video Space
Projects concerning the dissolve of the Performer-Audience & Private  
Space-Pubic Space Divide

a TOPLAP Certification and Award scheme? Now I know you're not serious....

I'm interested in why the wired article is so controversial with you guys.
It's how I found out about livecoding and TOPLAP.

If the article promotes awareness for your art and encourages people to
learn about it and contribute to it...what's really the problem?

Wired will do a proper story when there's someone or something to do it on.
That was more of a blurb.  If there were a big conference or a livecoder got
famous, they'd expend a lot more resources creating the article.

The best way to nurture our shared art/hobby is to let it grow organically
and on its own -- imposing a hierarchy from above is counter productive.

I posted links to the article on a few fora because it seemed like a
better introduction then most, then I chanced upon some other
discussions.

The idea that livecoders are "accedemic" or "showing off" seems quite
popular. I found that a bit odd; the big central texts on livecoding
tend to place a lot of emphasis on getting drunk in clubs, we poke a
lot of fun at ourselves too; the average discussion on the virtues of
groveboxes place less emhasis on the posibility of laptop crashes then
we do.

What I suspect we are dealing with isn't all that interesting even
from a cultural or artistic perspective (with all due respect to the
interesting texts some people write). I think we are dealing with
human nature, I think many of those comenting feel slightly
intimidated. Programing has a reputation of being "hard", I think many
people believe it's too hard for them and get the subconcious urge to
hide this and thus attack their source of insecurity.

If I'm right and we would like livecoding to become more popular and
less preceived as a elitist thing I think more emphasis should be
placed on how accessible it can be. I haven't played that much with
the other systems that people here are using but as a language I think
ChucK is very easy to get into (never mind that some of the more
advanced stuff can get a little muddy....).

It's one thing to plead that computer code is inherently expressive
but if we'd place emphasis on that programing need not be that hard
and can be a lot of fun I suspect people will discover the expressive
side on their own in one evening.

I don't realy blame Wired for what they did. They wanted to explain
programing can be a musical instrument and at that point "strings"
seem like a fun joke... It's a shallow perspective and I fail to see
why you'd drop another instrument for it too but it's a acessible
angle. In the end Wired is entertainment and so they need a little
drama, I don't think too many people take that seriously.

My cents,
Kas.

Yes, I think we are sorely lacking in this area. It's hard though -
programming has such a stigma, as you say, that it's difficult to convinc=
e
people that it has a place in their life (even though it's hard to find
someone who has never run a program these days).

One of the most rewarding aspects of livecoding for me is that you can us=
e
it to explain what programming is and what you do with it, to people who
would not normally take the time to find out. The live aspect means that
they can see mistakes and disasters happen and it becomes obvious that yo=
u
don't have to be insanely clever to do this (or if you do, we certainly
aren't).

Coming back to the article, I do think a good protection against people
getting the wrong idea from TOPLAP is to make it completely ridiculous.

dave

Unfortunately the TOPLAP certification scheme for becoming a live coding

average human lifetime.

If only we could automate this process and get rid of those awkward human

Yes the article I linked to covers much of this:
http://www.psych.unimelb.edu.au/staff/jp/improv-methods.pdf

Although the PDF isn't great quality the content is very interesting.  I
haven't finished digesting it myself so can't offer a good summary.
However Jazz improvisation does feature in his review and I believe what
you're talking about here is the optional 'referent' in his model.

Once it's written and is not in a form easily changed then I suppose it
is as dead as a finished painting.

It might be useful to think of the difference between live and library
code as analogous to the difference between spoken and written language.

Yes I agree.  At the moment I'm hoping to absorb such patterns into the
syntax of the language rather than a library, although I'm not
completely clear about the difference.

I hadn't seen that, it's a good one.  It's strange though how the
overall tone is negative but when you read the posts you realise that
probably more than half of the people are at least interested in the
idea, and many positively enthusiastic.  Only one person is wilfully
ignorant (yes Perl is interpreted, that's how you can livecode with
it!).

So it makes a couple of people go crazy and they are the most vocal
ones.  But yes they're doing the promotional work for us, and so we
should definitely push them as you say.

Someone there makes the fair point that good livecoding output isn't
readily available.  The demo I did at cybersonica that Robert videoed
and linked to from the wired article was terrible for example, although
I was clear to explain beforehand that it was a demo, not a performance,
that I usually perform with others etc.  We should probably try harder
to document performances so we have the evidence when we do a good one.
The performance Ade, Dave and I did at sonar last year was a corker (to
my memory), it's a shame we don't have the video...  Maybe we should use
screencast software.

Also I agree with Kassen, we should point out how accessible this stuff
is, not by dumbing down but by encouraging people to learn stuff like
Chuck and SC.  I occasionally get people asking me how to set up
livecoding with Perl and it's just too difficult...  But we should have
a "how do I start?" page on the TOPLAP wiki.

Of course making immediately accessible things like the totally amazing
looking betablocker makes an open doorway that people like "cunt" in the
phorum would find hard to argue against.  Robert was really reporting
his understanding of live coding, and I think he tried pretty hard to
understand it.  The sub-ed probably obfuscated his article a fair bit
and he didn't give us the opportunity to check over his words (which I
guess is standard journalistic process), but the outcome isn't all that
bad I don't think.

By the way I'm going to present my experiments with livecoding with
Haskell at this event in London UK on Tuesday:

That's fair and a lot of enjoyment can be had without caring but I still
-perhaps somewhat concervatively- hold that if you don't care about what
others say or think you shouldn't go climb on stages.

To me performance is about comunication and I think it stands to reason that
this holds especially true for livecoding.


If nobody cares it saves a expensive projection monitor but it also saves
people that might get a different perspective on loops and breaks in music.
As a whole Toplap does seem to care; it would be kind of odd to write
manifestos if you (they? / we?) didn't.

I'm new to this list, found you all via the Wired article.  I would
love to see some "how do I start?" articles up on the wiki.  "Hacking
perl in nightclubs" is a good read, but I felt might leave some
new-comers in the dust.  I have wanted to dive into Chuck or Fluxus,
but haven't had the time....perhaps some nice short tutorials,
(screencasts would be awesome!) on some of the basics.

Livecoding has a very bright future (IMHO), not just in the
performance/art space, but in computing in general.  I think you guys
are doing groundbreaking work, keep it up!

As far as SC is concerned, I've written a tutorial which is included 
in SuperCollider (you find it in Help/JITLib). It also explains some 
basic considerations and brings you step-by-step from small 
one-liners to more "advanced" examples.

what I find interesting is that there is a pretty strong 
anti-intellectual current in the critique. I think it is due to the 
fact that for many people education and university are things they 
are afraid of.

A while ago Fredik and I performed in Berlin and set up the place 
like a classroom - us two sitting in the front row next to each other 
(like the eager pupils) and the audience was granted a seat in the 
back rows (the concert was called 0th hour, after the computer 
courses in german schools in the 80s where one had to come to school 
befor the 1st hour, at 7:15).

In a time where (at least in Europe) universities are getting 
inceasingly commercial, for me live coding becomes more and more a 
political issue. Not in terms of "producing" something "intellectual" 
for a "naive" audience, but as a displacement of thinking styles. I 
think eventually "intellectual" simply means to get used to be 
confronted with things one doesn't understand.

Irritainment is essential to deconditioning. Deconditioning is 
essential to the development of a sense of possibility. A sense of 
possibility is essential to the possibility of being entertained by 
irritation.

Universities belong to the state. The state belongs to the people. 
But whoever isn't interested doesn't have to join a live coding 
concert.

I found this very useful thanks Reg.  I lifted the OpenSoundControl
library out of it (under terms of the GPL), and with that and hs-plugins
I got something rudimentary working:
  http://yaxu.org/20/hs.avi

The code is nasty but available on request.  The audio doesn't jump so
much on recompilation without the screencast software encoding...

I'm going to present this in London at techa kucha on Tuesday: 
  http://upcoming.org/event/89975/

For comparison I also did a quick perl screencast:
  http://yaxu.org/20/pl.avi

Maybe also interesting is the packet forth presentation at dorkbotlondon
on Wednesday:
  http://dorkbot.org/dorkbotlondon/20060726.shtml

Tom is presenting packet forth for micro-controllers but I believe
they're also using it for interactive programming.

I think it's OT :)

A patched version of ffmpeg, as per these instructions:
  http://ubuntu.wordpress.com/2006/06/08/how-to-create-a-screencast-in-ub=
untu/

I reduced the framerate somewhat, but otherwise that's what I did.

I think the headers may be corrupted, maybe because I quit with ctrl-c in=
stead of pressing c.

I made this script which allows you to click on the window you want to gr=
ab:

#!/bin/bash
xwininfo|perl -e '$_ =3D join("", <STDIN>); my($x) =3D /X:\s+(\d+)/s; my(=

000 -r 4 -g 300 -vd x11:$x,$y -s ${w}x$h $ARGV[0]\n")' $1

There is made-for-purpose screencast software available but it
coredumped on my laptop and didn't record sound.

Andrew Sorensen has is an introductory video for Impromptu that steps

I meant I don't think it's OT (getting confused because "on topic" and

interested in ways of recording screens as well as displaying it.

Here is an older video demo of chuck/audicle.  The
compression is goofy and big (65mb) but it shows
one of many ways to chuck.  More of a demo than
a tutorial.

Dear all,

The new miniAudicle, now for OS X, Linux, and Windows, have been
released (see notes below).  It's an integrated editor and ChucK virtual
machine, and provides syntax coloring and on-the-fly programming
control.  It's also a fun way to learn ChucK.

More links from the toplap wiki:

Let us know of your thoughts, suggestions, and any questions.  Post
to the mailing lists (http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/community/) or email
us.  The thing is still very experimental (especially on linux and=20
windows),
but can be a very useful companion/alternative to the classic command

Keep on ChucKin'...

Hello,


miniAudicle-0.1.3.3 (alpha) is now available.


      http://audicle.cs.princeton.edu/mini/

      (may need to reload)


This is the first miniAudicle version for which (experimental, but =20

Additionally, a big CPU draining bug present in previous 0.1.3.x =20

releases was fixed for miniAudicle OS X (upgrade recommended).


Windows and Linux miniAudicle do not currently support as many =20

features as OS X miniAudicle, but feature-parity is an eventual =20

goal.  Specifically, miniAudicle User Interface elements are not yet =20

supported for Linux and Windows.  A Windows binary executable is =20

available; Linux miniAudicle is for now source-only.


Special thanks to J=F6rg Piringer and his excellent OSCSurface project =20=

Subject: Re: [livecode] livecode gets angry comments


i think it would also be useful to have some sort of "how to get started" 
for audiences. a lot of the complaints about livecoding are that watching 
people program must be boring, and would take all the fun out of a musical 
performance. and if all you know about livecoding is that it's "watching 
people program onstage" it does sound boring, doesn't it?

for me this is ironic, because my main interest in livecoding is that i 
find most electronic music / visual live performances boring. not the 
music, just the performance. it's like my guitar teacher said a very long 
time ago, when popular music as we knew it was still guitars, bass and 
drums: "computers will never replace humans for making music. people want 
to watch humans performing."

but what about when a computer is performed by a person? if you can't tell 
the person is performing it, then what's the difference? various of us 
have said at various times, that a lot of electronic music / visual 
performers might be writing e-mail on stage. 

the point of livecoding is to show the *performance*, right? the 
equivalent of the fingering on a guitar, the hitting of the drums, etc... 
the kinetics of electronic performance...  it's not the same of course, 
because the computer is a different animal than a mechanical instrument.  
and we've discussed lots of times the problem of making coding interesting 
as a mode of performance, which is an ongoing and somewhat individual 
dilemma we each work on.  but - livecoding does give the audience a means 
to experience the human aspect of computer performance.

i think that doesn't come across well in articles/discussions about 
livecoding.... and probably the website could be more audience-oriented as 
well. big link "livecoding for audiences" maybe?

Subject: [livecode] Live Coding Practice


Fredrik and I have become convinced that we actually need to do some live 
coding practice every day like diligent instrumentalists. We have decided 
to do one session a day of dedicated practice for the month of August. 
SuperCollider will be our language platform. In order to force ourselves to 
do the hard work, and to make it accessible to those who might be curious 
or not believe us, and we will post our text files and any comments in a 
live coding blog via the TOPLAP wiki and SuperCollider swiki:

http://new.toplap.org/index.php/Live_Coding_Practice

At the end of the month we might release audio of our favourite bits.

(I've also added some draft practice exercise ideas and linked to the 
coding grades)

I'm curious to see if we will be any better after a month? Personally, my 
first three aren't very good, and I got hung up on some technical 
explorations rather than production. Must do better.

If anyone wants to join in the challenge feel free!

Yep this is really great idea.  Would like to join in but I'm away next
week which would break up the flow somewhat.  I'll try to add something
tonight tho

Also I'm kind of between livecoding systems, a bit bored of Perl but my
haskell isn't near up to scratch yet.  I guess I will start with Perl
and that might inform my Haskell system.

By the way I'm in contact with Access Space in Sheffield, UK who want to
do some big livecoding event next year, affiliated with TOPLAP.  Early
days yet but I will keep you informed.  Could be a good opportunity for
a proper international TOPLAP event.

Finally a couple of journalists are contacting me for photos etc as they
write up the wired story for their own country.  Today it is Jack

.store called .interpret
.interpret sets the cmdLine (see sc-dev mail I sent).

so I can do .compile.value instead.

Hello Alex

I'm glad you found the link useful, and your movie is a nice record  
of your work. Do you know Alberto da Campo's new "History" class for  
SC? - the most efficient way to record live-coding. Many were very  
impressed with this at recent SC conference. Very useful to have the  
"History Reapeats" panel... Julian R mentions History class in recent  
"Re: [livecode] Live Coding Practice" email.

I have moved to Cambridge now, making trips to dorkbot and gigs still  
possible, but not quite as easy to do ;-(

thanks for the History fix Julian, I'm now using the History class for

interesting to look back at how long I lose myself sometimes trying to

I think it is better actually to get it from the .document format, 
which is more readeable. Maybe we should allow for one more digit in 
the time (10ms should be fine as haptic rate resolution?).

easy to implement, even perhaps from the .document output? ah, yes, I see

why not 1ms format anyway? Though there could be weird interactions based 
on sending time whatever we do, since waveform level sync not guaranteed 
without sendBundle/OffsetOut and originals won't often involve that.

haptic rate resolution is 15Hz ie 67 msec. Typing world record is 12 Hz 
(characters). But delaying and choosing when to press enter could have more 
resolution I guess!

I am unfamiliar with the history class, but being able to (re)render
sessions sounds very useful. Could someone explain how it works?

The History class (originally by Alberto de Campo) is for SuperCollider. SC 
keeps track of the any text string that is to be interpreted, and allows a 
callback function to be passed this text whenever the interpreter is 
invoked. History overwrites the callback to store any interpreted strings, 
noting the system time at which they occurred. This just gives a list of 
all the commands in time, the History, which can then be stored in various 
document formats, and indeed, played back by reinterpreting the appropriate 
strings in order at the given times.

This should be straightforward to implement for any livecoding systems in 
which it does not already exist- ie, whenever you add a semicolon, press 
enter. Perhaps it's harder (to get a compressed version) if you're just 
taking snapshots with every document poll and only storing modified lines.

(it occurs that whilst it might lead to errors through undeclared or 
wrongly initialised vars, you could start permuting the playback order 
and/or timing and manipulate new patches out of existing ones- I could 
pretend to type a lot quicker than I actually do!)

Ahh, thanks very much. So where you say that you can render back your
own performance you will get the audio part but not be able to see all
of the typeing (live bug fixing) that went into it?

I'm thinking that a collection of recorded sessions (edit history)
where we could watch code being written in real-time would be a very
useful learning tool. This is similar to people saying that we should
take videos of our screen, but storing it by programmer edits might
lead to things like...

...or if you could could code side-by-side with a replay of a previous
session and then merge the result. That might be fun and an
interesting way to share material.

Thanks again,

http://vvvv.org/tiki-index.php
>From the site:
"vvvv is a toolkit for real time video synthesis. It is designed to
facilitate the handling of large media environments with physical
interfaces, real-time motion graphics, audio and video that can
interact with many users simultaneously.

vvvv uses a visual programming interface. Therefore it provides a
graphical programming language for easy prototyping and development.

vvvv is real time. where many other languages have distinct modes for
building and running programs, vvvv only has one mode - runtime."
Reminds me of Max/MSP....

This looks to be more focused on the visual than audio, but I think
the "visual coding platform" is interesting.  What does the toplap
community think of visual coding vs textual coding?

If you can show the construction/manipulation of an algorithm its ok I 
believe. For Max/MSP style use, there were some good demonstrations going 
on in Belgium as short contests, so nothing to exclude visual programming 
languages per se. Further, visual output is totally ok- look at fluxus or 
The Thingee.

Problems start when all is hardcoded beforehand and unobservable, and you 
only play with parameters via widgets. You might get away with it if your 
performance itself followed and rewrote instructions (independent of the 
software).

Subject: [livecode] Hyperyarn: a conceptual artware overcoded in 20 minutes
Date: Thu, 10 Aug 2006 23:06:57 -0500


# ANNOUNCEMENT:

Hyperyarn, a conceptual artware, will be overcoded by criticalartware  
core.developers in 20 minutes during ISEA2006!

criticalartware core.developers based in Chicago IL .US are  
participating in ISEA2006 in San Jose CA .US via the re:mote program  
curated by Adam Hyde with an 'overcoded' [presentation/performance].  
join criticalartware to collaboratively overcode the Open Source  
Hyperyarn artware application during this 20 minute artware  
development session:

http://hyperyarn.criticalartware.net

[+/or] just view the source tree grow as script kittens get stuck  
climbing in these branching metastructures:

http://hyperyarn.criticalartware.net/remote

Enjoy extreme programming style collaborative codeworking, discursive  
hyperactivity + deeply self-referential intertwingularity in this  
experimental Multi-Protocol Realtime Communication Client Server  
Application + Live Coding Environment!

Hyperyarn will be overcoded on FRI 2006.08.11 @ 3 PM PDT (Pacific  
Daylight Time) if you are in San Jose CA .US [+/or] 5 PM (Central  
Daylight Time) if you are in Chicago IL .US [+/or] 958 Internet Time

or] GMT (Greenwich Mean Time) everywarez...

# SHORT DESCRIPTION:

Hyperyarn: A Multi-Protocol Realtime Communication Client Server  
Application + Live Coding Environment

Hyperyarn is a conceptual artware project by criticalartware  
functioning as an Open Source experimental Multi-Protocol Realtime  
Communication Client Server Application + Live Coding Environment.  
Inspired by + intertwingled with Ted Nelson's Xanadu system + Marcel  
Duchamp's Mile of String project, Hyperyarn hopes to entangle script  
kitties in playful games of pseudo-codes, self-recursive systems,  
extreme programming, realtime data processing + collaborative  
exchange. Enabling + decentralizing discourse, Hyperyarn facilitates  
realtime communication on a distributed network between client/server  
applications. These applications, otherwise known as criticalartware  
core.developers, will collectively improvise live codework,  
discursive hyperactivity + extreme programming of Open Source artware  
systems. criticalartware presents Hyperyarn within the ISEA2006  
re:mote program during criticalartware's "overcoded: live codework,  
artware discussion + hyperweaving session" [performance/ 
presentation]. As a Live Coding Environment, Hyperyarn includes a  
self-modifying source code editor, compiler, virtual machine +  
debugger with network support for collaborative + performative  
programming projects. Hyperyarn is written in Hyperyarn to increase  
self-reflexivity + recursiveness. Allowing users to connect through  
insecure proxies during live coding sessions, Hyperyarn further  
complicates + problematizes assumptions + foregrounds conceptual  
artware instability, temporality + speculativity. Hyperyarn provides  
cross platform support for human computers, computational systems +  
mobile devices + is released under the GNU GPL.

# LONG DESCRIPTION:

Hyperyarn: A Multi-Protocol Realtime Communication Client Server  
Application + Live Coding Environment

// start coding: 2006.08.11 13:00 PM CST
//   end coding: 2006.08.11 13:20 PM CST

Hyperyarn is a conceptual artware project by criticalartware  
functioning as an Open Source experimental Multi-Protocol Realtime  
Communication Client Server Application + Live Coding Environment.  
Hyperyarn is inspired by + intertwingled with ideas such as Ted  
Nelson's speculative Xanadu systems + Marcel Duchamp's Mile of String  
project. Hyperyarn hopes to variously entangle script kitties across  
multiple interwoven {ports|paths} including runme.org, _arc.hive_,  
Rhizome.org + other ports in playful pseudo-codes, self-recursive  
systems, extreme programming, realtime data processing +  
collaborative exchange. Enabling + decentralizing discourse,  
Hyperyarn facilitates realtime communication on a distributed network  
between client/server applications. These applications, otherwise  
known as criticalartware core.developers, will utilize Hyperyarn's  
encrypted modes (including 1337 speak, artspeak, Jargon Files,  
critical discourse + Hyperyarn source codes) to collectively  
improvise live codework, discursive hyperactivity + extreme  
programming of Open Source artware systems. As a conceptual artware  
project, Hyperyarn is {actualized|activated} through the process of  
it's own articulation + documentation of the conversational exchanges  
that constitute this open artware system.

criticalartware presents Hyperyarn within the ISEA2006 re:mote  
program during criticalartware's "overcoded: live codework, artware  
discussion + hyperweaving session" [performance/presentation]. during  
"overcoded" criticalartware core.developers engage multiple  
discursive modalities simultaneously in an open cacophonious jam,  
improvising collaborative strategies of live codework, discursive  
hyperactivity, open artware development + extreme programming. this  
sessioning of theorypractices will crease, expand, infold, encode +  
translate variously interwoven [hacker/cracker] cultures to  
interrogate the elitism of "leet speek" as artspeak + artworld  
flirtations with naive outsider status in the formation of marketable  
artistic identities while pouring a warm bowl of welcoming milk for  
would be script kittens across distributed ports, applications +  
platforms. those who login to these conversational networks will  
{play|participate} in performative social constructions, commenting  
up contingent pseudo codes of temporary artware systems (i.e.  
Hyperyarn) + exploit scripts, criss-cross + cross-post on networks of  
meaning, bounce messages like balls of unspooling Hyperyarn + install  
online entanglements with a Duchampian Mile of String during ISEA 2006.

As a Live Coding Environment, Hyperyarn includes a self-modifying  
source code editor, compiler, virtual machine + debugger with network  
support for collaborative + performative programming projects.  
Hyperyarn seeks to maintain strict Toplap compliancy as a Live Coding  
Environment by positioning Coding as a Conceptual Act of Social  
Artware. Congruent with strict Toplap compliancy standards, Hyperyans  
offers developers a conceptual coding environment to perform realtime  
artware development + [hacker/cracker/coder/artist/script kitty]  
identity constructions in realtime edge to edge autonmy +  
interdependence. Hyperyarn is written in Hyperyarn to increase self- 
reflexivity + recursiveness. Hyperyarn allows users to connect  
through insecure proxies during live coding sessions to further  
complicate + problematize assumptions + foreground conceptual artware  
instability, temporality + speculativity. Hyperyarn provides cross  
platform support for human computers, computational systems + mobile  
devices + is released under the GNU GPL.

diagrammatic languages == text based languages

for instance, uml is a system for writing C++ (among other things) via
various diagrams and outputs compilable C++, these diagrams can be
generated from existing source code - they just represent a different
view on the same thing

While I would not reject "diagrammatic live coding" per se, I don't 
agree with your use of "just .. a dfferent view on the same thing". 
It is the view that makes the difference. This is one of the things 
that become evident specially in live coding since the program 
consists also in the programmer modifying the structure of 
representation.
The traditional product-oriented view of software design does not 
apply to experimental programming, because, as in mathematics, the 
formalism cannot be treated as if it were completely transparent.

It does make a difference, but I can't see how this is different to any
other choice in language. Text is no more or less abstract than diagrams
as far as the machine is concerned. This is one of the things I was
thinking about writing betablocker.

Yes, this is an interesting question. I wonder if on such a general 
level any distinction can be made.

What I always wonder about is how you express programmatic changes of 
program structure (dynamic graphs) in a diagram?

like this pseudocode

sound = [a, b, c]
wait 10 s
sound [b, c, a]

Yep but UML diagrams contain text, and AFAIK while you can generate
stubs and move things around you can't transform a whole C++ program
into UML and back again.

Programs written in textual languages can sometimes look like little
diagrams, particularly in the programmer's use of whitespace (whether
the whitespace is ignored by the lexer or not).  We're laying out groups
of symbols in meaningful ways.

However there is something special about languages rich enough to allow
such things as introspection, self-description and so on.  I guess to
find that richness you can't rely on simple diagrammatic symbols that
have meanings, and instead have to combine symbols to make words and
sentences, at which point you have text.

A lot of large scale software development is done wholly in UML, which
is then converted to C++ and built. I've never used it myself, but it is
reported to make the process of planning and detecting errors on a high
level system much easier, more so than text, which lends itself to
thinking about the details, rather than the interaction between the
parts of a system. 

In these sorts of development, the only hand written code is for jobs
like the low level drivers that communicate with the outside world.

There is no reason that this can't be done with a diagramatic language
as far as I am aware. For example, I've been playing around with a
script that converts lispy languages into dot graphs, it's not working
properly yet, but here is the graph representation of the program
itself:

http://www.pawfal.org/dave/images/dotty.png

I just wanted to know what they looked like, but there is no reason you
couldn't write an editor that allowed you to build programs like this.

Then I stand corrected...  My understanding was that a lot of UML
modelling was done in English, which was then manually converted to
code.  I imagine that this stuff is highly specific to the domain of
business logic though.

Oh I agree.  I'm just trying to address the problem of defining what
livecoding is.  If we can say that it's possible to livecode with
'visual' interfaces (although text is a visual medium, or at least
piggybacks on one), we need to work out what it is about languages that
makes them good for (certain kinds of) livecoding.  I think it would be
useful to be able to say what livecoding is and isn't.  Thinking about
diagrammatic languages might actually help us do that.

Very nice!  There is still some text there, it might be fun to replace
each token with a unicode character.  Otherwise I suppose the difference
is that relationships between tokens are shown explicitly with lines,
rather than just their position on the page.

I can imagine an editor where you can program 'traditionally' using word
order rules, and then pick up and drop a block of text to a different
part of the page, and having a line magically appear showing its
context...  Allowing a hybrid between traditional and diagrammatic
programming.

This wouldn't be far at all from whitespace rules in haskell, where you
can ident lines to indicate block level, or alternatively use braces to
explicitly define blocks and lay things out however you like.

Agreed, but what would be the point?

I could be wrong, but is that effectively just a parse tree?

I'm thinking that syntax highlighting is a good example of adding a
visual aspect to textual languages. I like the idea of having
one-to-one mapping between a textual language and a number of
graphical representations which made implicit information explicit and
also allowed the programmer to manipulate the graphical representation.

You're not wrong, but it's still a graph representation of the program 
itself. You see, with lispy languages, the structure of the source code 
pretty much is the structure of the parse tree, is the structure of the 
compiled program code. (Not at the machine code level for most 
architectures, but at the VM or interpreter level.) This it's why it's 
trivial to write a Lisp interpreter in Lisp, but lots of work to write a 
C++ compiler in C++. (More specifically, the reason is Lisp's 
homoiconicity [0]).

I think that it's initially used as a planning tool, but the idea is
that it generates code, and in some instances can be compiled directly.

It definately comes from the business end of the IT industry, with
prices to match, but there are free versions availible:

Or the brackets, and this is the point I feel - that for some people
diagrams are more useful than text for programming. For some tasks
(designing large programs) text is a hindrance. Really programming has
nothing to do with text - it's just the culture which it has grown up
with.

I think the use of diagrammatic programming languages are interesting
for livecoding as it can make programs easier to read at a glance,
without as much need to understand the syntax - which might make for
more audience friendly performances.

StarLogo is an interesting language in this context:

If I had more time I'd write a starlogo style interface for fluxus...

not quite, you get a list in an updating GUI
of each line (or 1st line if part of a block) of code that has been  
evaluated,
along with who wrote the code (for networking stuff)
and the time in seconds against each since History started.

If you click on a line item in the GUI,
you get a new text document opened (or an option to overwrite an  
existing one)
with the complete code in it's original form - eg a whole block.
If you want the audio back, just reevaluate the code that History has  
returned to you.

I guess history is more efficient as only evaluated code is recorded.

This would be possible with a few little extensions to the history

Subject: [livecode] book
From: alex <alex
Date: Sun, 27 Aug 2006 11:43:32 +0100



I was wondering if anyone's thought of writing a book about livecoding.
Either way, is it a good idea?  My initial thought was that we could put
together a proposal to o'reilly as an excercise, and if they don't
accept it go ahead anyway, perhaps as a wikibook.

I don't know if it would really fit into o'reilly's series but I'm
thinking an introductory chapter about each of the main systems, a
chapter on the theory of interactive programming, a chapter about the
technicalities of doing so in a range of languages, a bit about cutting
edge livecoding techniques - use of history, the blurring between code
and GUI and so on...  So instructive but still with plenty room for
humour.

On one hand a publisher like O'Reilly won't like a proposal with more
than a few authors, and on the other a wikibook should have as many as
possible...  So we see who's interested I guess.

On the other hand maybe this is a bad/old fashioned idea and we should
just stick with the wikis we already have.  I just think it might be
something fun to work towards.

An edited book with chapters contributed by different authors could be the 
most democratic. Certainly, an O'Reilly's type how-to guide wouldn't have 
so many authors.

I like the way we've tried to be quite open via this list in the past. 
Books aren't for everyone though because there is either an open call 
followed by a review process which may not let everyone through, or a small 
core of authors who take responsibility for their own output, and you might 
be tied by a publishing contract to not put any parts online in a wiki as 
you write.

(Not sure live coding is sufficiently established to allow for a book yet, 
but then, perhaps the establishment is an outcome of creating a book! )

Alternative possibilties might be a conference (with proceedings) on live 
coding. Or to actually hold the World Live Coding Championships.

Perhaps in the short-term the wiki world is fine, but happy to hear of any 
longer term thoughts like this.

I did investigate with one academic journal about a special issue on live 
coding, though they could only guarantee space at the earliest in 2009. And 
the more widely distributed press articles are a better promotion if that 
is the main aim of writing.

Anyway, happy to be involved whatever gets decided.

Hi Folks,

I think there is some merit in a live coding book, but unification of  
content will be demanding.

I think Friends of Ed would be a good publisher to approach. A model  
is the "Flash Math Creativity" book they publish. Where many  
contributors explain and show a few illustrated coding tricks. A  
format for pseudo code could be agreed upon as well as "real" code in  
what ever language each author preferred. Another complication is  
audio! These books work well for graphics but less well for sound so  
it would need to come with a CD in my view and there would need to be  
a way to visualise the music - piano roll, wave forms etc.. to  
provide some visual interest.

And someone (or a small group) have to edit it  :)

Andrew Brown

In the case of visualisation, shouldn't the actual code be used? I think it
would make sense to use the exact images that would be send to the projector
in a live situation.

What would be most interesting to me (but hard to realise) would be a DVD
using multiple angles. One angle would be a (or several) video cameras aimed
at the performer, the other would be a exact copy of the stream fed to the
projector.

This would remidy the main problem (at least to me) with the online clips I
saw so far of livecoding performances; you can get some idea of the
atmosphere but the screen can't be read.


I imagine this would demand either one or several events that would be the
livecoding equivalent of those parties punk bands have to record the
material live. DVD seems like a perfect (if hard to realise) medium for
this, multiple audio streams could evenbe used to switch between a direct
feed from the computer and a microphone recording.


Just some impulsive cents from me...

Yours,
Kas.

hi nick and livers

again,  the digital art weeks will put some effort into creating a  
space and platform
for live-coding next year. we have not put out the calls yet, but any  
suggstions are welcome.

this years activities included three lectures and performance from  
known live coders.

i think doing a World Live Coding Contest" in the famous Cabaret  
Voltaire would be
more than approriate fun.

the flash math books a lot. for live-coding i think it would be really 
impressive to have some way of showing the code evolving so that's 
maybe how a DVD could come in pretty handy. the problem is that with 
the flash math book for example it's pretty easy to image the stills in 
motion if you know a little bit of actionscript etc, but for live-code 
it might be tricky to find a way to make readers understand how a

I am in the same boat....

do it justice, especially to someone who has never seen it.

I think we are missing a big point here, live-coding is about
performances!  I, personally, really like the idea of a

organizing small get-together in various cities to allow people to
"show their stuff", talk about it, maybe do little trainings.  let

Yeah, Friends of Ed. Heh. They went bust. I don't think it was my

Well, count me in if a book looks likely. Happy to contribute both

can think of an inspirational way to get round the 'a book is not a

One idea just off the top of my head (i havent slept much) is maybe if 
we could get a publisher to take some risks and perhaps include 
sections of transparent or clear pages. that way you could have printed 
perl code (or whatever) on a bunch of repeating pages to show how it 
changes over each iteration...

me too - I've been making movies for a potential dvd for a while.

the interesting thing about dvds is that you can put the code in the
subtitles layer. it has it's limitations, but it would be a great way of
documenting a performance, allowing viewers to select different
performers code subtitles over the recorded performance.

a book also has it's advantages though - perhaps we should do both? :)

Subject: [livecode] after practising for a month


Dear all,
         I thought I'd make a quick report after practising live coding 
(with SuperCollider) every day for the month of August. The code archive is 
here and I've also rendered a few mp3s just to give some idea of how it 
sounded (there is a lot more material to convert here, but at least you can 
hear a few moments):

http://swiki.hfbk-hamburg.de:8888/MusicTechnology/815

Main discoveries (initial thoughts, I haven't looked back through the 
sessions extensively at this point):

1) It's very tiring, particularly after a day of computer based work. It's 
not relaxing/alternative stimulation, and for that I miss piano/violin 
practice, which I forsook while I've been doing this.

2) Quality varies very much, often correlated to what time of day I might 
have been doing the session, but also based on the theme I choose for the 
day. One week I challenged myself to explore the 3x+1 problem, and the 
negotiations with the algorithmic theme probably became more refined as the 
week went on, though still varying in their musical effectiveness because 
of the further issue of psychological mapping etc. I found myself choosing 
between musical output and mathematical thinking. (perhaps there is a way 
to have one person map while another explores the maths?)

3) If I chose a tough theme, there would be a break at the start of the set 
while I tried to get some basic functions coded- sometimes 5 minutes before 
any sound! All the sessions were from scratch live coding, so either a 
forgiving connoisseur audience, a duet partner, or cover material for the 
early stages would help in dramatic presentation.

4)  However, I could often reach a critical point of complexity and breadth 
of material where unexpected and interesting results would flow, and there 
were enough voices to play with to maintain a musical exploration 
simultaneous to the algorithmic exploration. The Aug 4th session is a good 
demo of this happier state.

5) I got better at it, by introducing various shortcuts, by having certain 
synthesis and algo comp tricks in the fingers ready for episodes, and just 
by sheer repetition. I did try to use jitlib a few times, perhaps 
successfully on one occasion, though the habits of jitlib actually 
interfered with my standard non-jitlib habits, so I'd need a month on 
jitlib alone to cover that properly. I was happier without it (sorry 
Julian, though I did use Tdef every day!) just in the way that you get used 
to your own way of working, even though it might not be the best general 
approach.

Ok, enough from me, getting this out of my system. Now it's someone else's 
turn for September? I'd be curious to hear other people's impressions after 
they try this sort of exercise, feel free to email me off list, or post for 
everyone on list.

best
N

interesting to read. It seems that many things are really similar, 
and I think this is a reaction to the fact that programming is often 
seen very much as a tool, so the idea of effectiveness stumbles over 
its own feet.

Of course I don't agree with his notion of of "natural" and his 
antimathematical arguments. Thinking "naturally" is mediated already 
by cultural algorithms (language, images, abstractions etc.). 
Programming languages are a way to make this thinking explicit (and 
to be able to change it), however "unnatural" it might seem.

thoughts?

I agree with what you are saying regarding programming being a way to
make often unconscious thoughts "explicit". But in that process, I  
think we
often over-simplify and over-generalise (shall I use the word  
"sterilise"?)
the subtle texture of meaning and connotations that exist in the  
"analog"
world of say painting or guitar playing.

I'm not saying that thinking "naturally" is not algorithmic in the  
way you describe
above, I'm merely pointing out that abstracting thought into a  
programming language
is precisely that - an abstraction - and as such we loose something/ 
some things.

Of course guitar playing is an abstraction as well, but what I find  
interesting in
the "analog" world is that our thoughts (here moving fingers being a  
thought)
are not necessarily explicit (as is a necessity in thinking in code).

just a point : )

Hey Thor,

interesting topic.

Well in a way, what is really explicit in a guitar is the fact that 
the tone that I hear is a result of my finger position and pressure 
(on a grid) and certain movement patterns that I have learned, or 
found to be interesting. I think the finger-thought has its 
explication in the guitar, just as the programming-thought has its 
explication in the code. What is subtle in a program might be quite 
implicit as well - often it just very well-tuned or elegant.


I do agree that I can interact really differently with a guitar than 
in text. But I think this has more to do with culture than with 
nature. The difference in different types of abstractions make them 
perceptible. There is no original, "unabstracted", or at least I 
don't know where it should be.

Hi Julian,

there's a difference between 'natural' and algorithmic thinking you 
haven't considered so far: feedback

When you play a guitar, you get direct physical and instantaneous 
feedback from your fingers, which are also your input organ.
On the other hand, programming can only give you non-instantaneous 
feedback (whatever small the delay might be), which doesn't involve your 
input organ (fingers), but rather other senses (visual, acoustic).

This has certainly nothing to do with culture.

Finally, it is widely accepted in cognitive sciences that often one does 
already act before the 'act of action' gets in your consciousness.
This might be quite relevant for playing e.g. a guitar, whereas with 
programming, one definitely needs to be conscious about what you are 
writing (syntax restrictions etc.)
So, there's definitely not only different types of abstraction, but also 
quite different levels of abstraction, computer programming being at one 
of the highest levels.

We might be talking about this from a different level of abstraction,  
but to give an example
let's take a Jazz guitarist playing in a very good improv band. At a  
certain moment in a certain
piece, the guitarist might (consciously/unconsciously?) play a riff  
or bend the note (or whatever)
that refers to a certain style of blues-playing from 40 years  
earlier. This happened in the bliss of
the moment, absolutely unplanned. It might be so subtle that the  
audience would not notice it,
and perhaps only half of his/her co-players did.

Here we have an example of this kind of subtle cultural reference  
that I have in mind.

In order to do this programmatically, wouldn't you have to plan this  
ahead? And would you not
have to make a _generalisation_ of what this particular style of  
blues was essentially about and
include that abstraction (I'm hesitating to use the word  
"sterilisation" again) into your code? Then at
some point you would proudly "refer" to that in your coding session.

This is very different dynamic from the more spontaneous and  
"incorporated" decisions of the
guitarist.

I'm wondering if that Jazz guitarist's thought process is just as  
programmatic as the programmer's,
but it's just the tools/interfaces that are different. We have to  
work in a very conscious state
while coding in order to hit the right buttons and be sure that those  
brackets match, but what would
happen if we could program with an interface like the guitar? (i.e.  
where programming becomes
an embodied activity).

> What is subtle in a program might be quite implicit as well - often  
> it just very well-tuned or elegant.

Can you elaborate on that? I'd be interested in what you have in  
mind. But I am sure you are right
and I can think of some of the subtleties of programming (in say  
SuperCollider, ChucK or Fluxus)
coming from the design of those languages and further from languages  
in which they are written.
And the OS.

 From my perspective, I think it has to do with tools that force us  
to be conscious and alert (such
as the activity of typing a computer) vs. tools of which our  
"knowledge" is incorporated.

I think Jeff Pressing's model[1] of how people improvise comes in useful
here.  He characterises an improvisation as a series of clusters of
events (clusters of sounds).  A cluster ends and a new one begins when
the improviser decides to make a change to how they are playing -- he
calls this moment the "interrupt."  The actual generation of events
follows from this decision.  The decision is expressed as modification
of arrays of what he calls Objects, Features and Processes with some
reference to ecology to suggest how these arrays may be built during
one's life.  He also describes how feedback from the real results of
physical actions enacted by these events later influences following
decisions during an improvisation.

So in this model a livecoding improviser is not involved in the physical
playing (at least not in the same way) but I believe could make
interrupts approaching the same rate as someone playing a guitar.

Yes but I think there could be different levels of action (as above)
with different relationships with consciousness.

I don't think I am concious about language syntax when I am programming
any more often than when I am when I'm writing/speaking.

Aren't there syntax restrictions with the guitar too?  Some actions
result in a crash (broken strings/wood), or no change to the output, or
are simply impossible to play under normal conditions.  I may be
thinking wrongheadedly here though...

Yes, but perhaps it's an expression at a level of abstraction that is
not as visible with guitar playing but still present.

not in this scenario:

Feedback
means that the human being thinking (programming/playing guitar) is  
directly involved in a loop; that she dierectly gets the results of  
what she has done and reacts on this.

Recursion
on the other hand (in my view) happens only in the triggered /

Only if you maintain a view of flow as being entirely human, of course
in that case it will never match with livecoding which has both a human
and machine agents/actions.

If you view livecoding as symbiotic between man and machine then the
machine can achieve flow on one level (execution) and the human the
other (abstract concepts).  Indeed machines maintain many components of
flow at all times by default - clear goals, focus, no
self-consciousness, immediate feedback.

I also think you're assuming that achieving flow requires tangible
results and interaction with the outside world.  Of course humans are
able to achieve flow while for example writing a novel, because the
novel is developing in their heads as well as the page they do not have
to wait until they've finished writing a chapter before intertwining it
with the next...  When they eventually execute a chapter as a whole (by
reading it back) they may well find it ended up evoking something quite
different to how they imagined it to be, and may also find grammar
(syntax) errors that need correcting.  It's the same with programming.

More simply, based on my own experience, I simply do not believe that it
is not possible for a programmer to become productively lost in their
code.

I do view livecoding as symbiotic between man and machine, but I do  
not agree on your immediate feedback argument. When doing livecoding  
(also with practicing it) there is still a big gap between thinking  
of the thing you might want to do, converting it into valid code,  
write it down and finally send it to the interpreter. You do not get  
_direct_ feedback... What you get for this lack is perhaps a more  
abstract access to your idea: you do not have to care for every  
single sound...

I remember having this discussion with you 4 years ago : )
I wish I could understand it.

I am very sympathetic to Till's view regarding the Flow. But that's  
perhaps
what distinguishes a good programmer from a bad one : )

For me it's also a question of latency. If we could think programming  
and execute it
with our thoughts, i.e. not make it and then execute but have the  
making-and-the-executing
as the same process, then my goal would be achieved.

Consider the difference of thinking with your finger on the guitar  
fretboard and thinking
with your eyes on your text editor where you program. (and the  
importance of the ENTER button)

In fact this is the way I'd like to program:

The gap that is there, we should try and keep it open, as long as it 
is there. Often it disappears far too quickly. Isn't livecoding a way 
of reasoning rather than seamless virtuosity?

Recursion (certainly tail recursion) is feeding a function its own  
output from within the function itself. Hendrix, guitar and amp are  
mutually recursive. ;-)

"Flow" is a state of deep engagement with an immediate creative task.  
It is common to artists and hackers (I've observed this myself and  
asked other people about it) and is probably one of the things that  
confused Paul Graham. Watching Alex demonstrate livecoding it was  
obvious that speaking about what he was doing was interrupting him  
getting into a state of flow. So I can easily imagine flow in  
livecoding.

With a REPL (an interpreter or command line modifying the running  
code) your changes give pretty direct feedback.

Hm, I'm not sure if I see any gap.  I'm thinking of the thing I want to
do in terms of a language, so it's impossible for me to have an idea
that is not valid within that language.  So in the case of livecoding
there is no gap between thinking about what I want to do and the code.
I'm thinking it in code, both in terms of the structure of the code and
the equivalent sound structure it maps to.

Typing the code into the computer is a parallel process, and of course
what is realised may not mirror what I imagined for some reason,
undermining my earlier ideas and forcing me into some other direction.

(Like bum notes, syntax errors can be avoided with practice and so are
irrelevant to this discussion)

As Pressing suggests, guitarists and trombonist improvisers have the
same abstract access to their idea, and do not care for every single
sound either.  I encourage you to read the article.

I think that's just the thinking process.  I think you're right, there
is some explicit latency in the livecoding process, but I don't think
it's as great a problem as we might imagine...  It just changes how we
react to one another, and to our mistakes.  In any case, there are
always fundamental changes that we can make to a script in a matter of
seconds, and we can build up a complex script in many small steps, each
step in reaction to the result of an earlier step and to what
co-improvisers do.

No, that's precisely the point. When re-reading the sentence above I  
think
I should clarify that I meant "thinking with the finger" i.e. that the
thought itself is happening "in the finger" and not only in the brain.
(if that makes sense). Neither in typing nor guitar playing do I
think about what my fingers are doing. I'm just saying that thinking
and playing seem to be pretty much the same process (in real-time)
when playing acoustic instruments whereas thinking and programming
has this special latency.

That's where the Flow comes in. I agree that one can get totally  
absorbed
in a coding session but that's not the same type of (embodied) flow
that we have with the instruments we play.

: )
And text is certainly not bad. It's great to be explicit and define  
clearly
what one wants to do. Write it down in a text that a machine interprets.

Both worlds are wonderful. And for me the differences are interesting.

Hello all -<br>
<br>
Sorry to interrupt the debate. I work for Mongrel magazine, a monthly
youth-culture mag based in Dublin. We'd really like to do a feature on
livecoding - send a writer and photographer along to one of your shows,
maybe talk to a couple of livecoders about what they do, that sort of
thing. I think it could really help raise your profile, in the music
community as well as more broadly. But I can't find any information
anywhere about any upcoming shows, whether in the UK or elsewhere.
Could anyone help us out? Any info would be much appreciated.<br>

Muscle Memory is a term I remember hearing frequently as a
justification for "practice."  Be it playing soccer or playing piano,
the point of the practice was to train the subconscious parts of our
brain to react (or cause our body to react) in a certain way.  I
believe it is the ability to "push down" (in the cognitive sense) the
act of playing an instrument to lower levels of conciseness that
enables virtuosity.  Active consciousness is slow.  The notion of
"being in the zone" for physical endeavors such as sports or playing
an instrument is similar to the "flow" we describe when programming.
Our hands certainly can become accustomed to typing certain patterns (
hammering out System.out.println without even thinking....) but this
"muscle memory" is just language syntax.  Do our hands have the
ability to store actual algorithms?  That is to say, can we actually
train our subconscious to react to a situation with certain
algorithms?  Perhaps an efficient syntax would enable more direct
access to this Muscle Memory....

OR

Are we trying to offload the subconscious aspects of the endeavor to
the machine?  The machine memory IS our muscle memory, and the human
is the purely-conscious actor imbibing "will" to the machine.  Thus
the computer is merely an extension of ourselves.  So then I would ask
why bother with our hands at all?  (

But then I can counter-argue that a livecoder can think with the

Yep but by encoding your actions in a computer program you're trading
off latency for throughput.

It's also great to write code in a hurry that seems insane in retrospect
and obscures the original intention completely.

Agreed, but also the similarities are interesting too.

I feel I am playing devil's advocate here...

I haven't kept up with all this thread, but some thoughts...

I can't play a musical instrument, but I can say that the feeling of
livecoding is a similar feeling to painting or drawing a picture for me.
It does seem slightly stranger in this context to me to do this in front
of an audience - as it would to paint a picture in front of the audience
- but where code differs from paint is that it forms processes that can
react quickly and self modify, so maybe it's more like some form of
sculpture or improvised architecture. This is quite different in my mind
to how traditional musical instruments work, and I'm not sure that it's
desirable that they are seen to be similar. 

As far as muscle memory goes - I do feel that languages are too brittle
and unforgiving for the use we are putting them to for livecoding - one
of the reasons I became interested in scheme is that it reduces syntax
down to an absolute minimum. It's for similar reasons I've been playing
with greatly simplified virtual machines, in the case of betablocker,
that there is no simply no syntax at all. It might be possible to code
it drunk, which of course is my secret goal.

cheers,

dave

Yes of course. Even to the degree that a livecoder without a computer
could be a pretty miserable thinker. (the thoughts wouldn't go very far)

I think Andy Clark calls this extended cognition and claims that we're
already cyborgs just due to the fact that our "locus" of thinking is not
happening only in the head.

Anyhow, my original point was about this particular time lag that
is characteristic of coding as playing vs. direct playing (for lack of
better term)

Hi,

I started writing a book last year broadly tracing free software (and
its history) as/and art, kind of a primer with background and
speculation: specifying an artistic codebase with extensive practical
coverage of pluggability, extensible GNU/Emacs, promiscuous computing,
Lisp and fine excursions into random war and live coding amongst many
others.

At the moment, it sits sadly unfinished (after six chapters) as I
don't have time to work more on it. The plan is to expand the current
research for a POD (print on demand) publication, perhaps for early
next year. Some kind of free software POD workflow, using TeX and so
on would be great to have up and running. The question of format for
such a work is also interesting.

At the same time, we also have our first POD out this month (in
association with OpenMute), entitled xxxxx with plenty of code
listings, and contributions from (amongst many others) Florian Cramer,
Paul Graham, Graham Harwood, Friedrich Kittler, Otto Roessler, and
Gerald J. Sussman. The introduction is titled Life Coding, and stands
as a major thematic. xxxxx could function as an excellent testbed for
such publications and approaches.

best wishes

Hello,

i'm relatively new to the concept of livecoding, but as a
programmer/musician who has always been concerned with performance
issues, i'm inevitably drawn to the idea and i'm very glad there is a
burgeoning scene (well done everyone etc).

my problem is this - i'm in love with the idea of being able to
explore musical ideas live, through text alone (not sure why, but the
words purity, hardcore and post-digital spring to mind). however, i
simply cannot justify it, when the music i want to make is essentially
based around signal processing, and this is so much easier to
understand and edit in a graphical environment (pd for instance)
rather than text. it seems completely counter-intuitive to patch
modules together any other way. but i dont want to do this live,
because a pd patch is fugly compared to a simple console and reams of
text.

am i wrong? i hope so. i want to invest some time learning the
techniques and languages you guys are exploring at the moment, but i
just need a little more convincing to drag me away from pd..

I have good news for you: yes, you are wrong, text is much easier..

Wires and boxes are essentially nothing else than words: But a word 
can express a reference to something in one thing (well if you don't 
count each letter), whereas a wire has two (beginning and an end, 
even worse, a direction and also crosses other wires that it does not 
have to do anything with.). Multichannel expansion looks pretty, but 
barely readable.

When you want to write systems that modify graphs, wires are really a 
bit difficult (or, actually, I'd really like to see how a system 
looks like that expresses the rebuilding of wires and boxes with the 
help of wires and boxes).

It is hard to send wires and boxes via email and also I find it nice 
that I can use the same program for writing articles that I use for 
programming.

Generally, I think it is actually more intuitive to have a written 
base language that is human readable.

isn't it the ambiguous continuum between error and function what is 
interesting about interactive programming (as well as music 
improvisation)? The navigation on the border of slight difference 
between one's own expectation and the result? Then a precise language 
is much better, since it allows yourself and others to reach the 
glimpse of an understanding about what is going on.

On many systems, syntax errors are caught gracefully and do not even 
dare to touch the sound. What is more difficult is great deviations 
from what is tolerable to the ear - but well..

Uniqueness of what?

I was speculating that a language designed for representing such things
as business logic might not be ideal for representing music, and that
syntax errors may not be such an issue in a language designed for
livecoding.

> everybody would pay lots of money for?

Sure but when you're making music, tolerating faults means something
quite different from when you're modelling flight navigation systems or
proving mathematical models.

I think we're getting confused between syntax errors (instructions that
do not strictly conform to grammatical rules) and semantic errors
(playing a bum note).  It is all too easy to write a syntactically valid
program that plays bum notes - ie not the notes we were aiming it to
make.  

Avoiding syntax errors therefore allows unrestricted semantic error
making.

I was drawing an analogy between the constraints of languages and the
constraints of drumkits, trying to work out what the syntax of drum
playing would be.  I might well be talking nonsense there though.

no, I don't think so. But while I find that there is nothing 
specifically natural (in the sense as self-evident) way of 
programming or drumming, still I can tell a difference between a 
system that is well done, interesting or beautiful. The question is 
what makes it so?

This looks interesting. Is it perhaps too high level?

Here is a visual programming language which seems pretty low level:

http://visula.org/gallery.html

But one wonders why not just do it in text form? Seems unnecessary  
complex.


There was a conference on visual programming this week in Brighton:

Well, I thought it was myself controlling the programming with

But now when you mention it, it might be the homunculus in my head

Subject: [livecode] modes of livecoding
From: alex <alex
Date: Sun, 10 Sep 2006 12:39:41 +0100



I've found the recent discussion really interesting.  On one side it's
difficult to disagree with Thor's point of view which draws strong
distinction between improvised livecoding and (for example) improvised
guitar playing.  Fingers are only used transiently in livecoding,
whereas with the guitar the whole body is used.

On the other side I think the difference beyond that can be
overstated...  That we should be able 'tune out' and achieve 'flow'
despite being hunched up gazing into a laptop screen, the same way as we
might with a pencil and paper.  While potentially obstructive to this
state, I think we've largely agreed that syntax errors are not an
insurmountable problem. 

The other problem though is difficulty.  When sitting in front of an
empty editor with a turing complete language parser waiting for our
instructions, it might be difficult to decide what to do.  Particularly
if we want to respond to something another player is doing right now.

To get around that problem I think we need to realise that livecoding
need not involve solving difficult problems.  Instead, at any moment we
should have a number of options of ways to change an algorithm that
could take just a few seconds to apply.  

What of any worth could be done in a few seconds?  We could change the
class of sound we're using, for example change from a triangle to a
square wave or from a cymbal sample to a tb303 sample.  We could change
an effect we're applying such as the reverb depth or modulation.  Or we
could apply some pre-defined process that changes some other aspect of
the algorithm over time.

In preparation for a performance we extend the language we're using by
adding libraries and perhaps even syntax such as infix operators to
provide ourselves with such familiar choices during a performance.

The key here I think is in recognising that *a livecoding performance is
not necessarily profoundly creative*.  That is, although we will
undoubtedly produce a unique performance we are unlikely to find novel
ways of performing while we're doing so.  Instead we will be exploring
our style of performance and perhaps combining the style of other
performers, producing a hybrid performance.  

In short I think perhaps livecoding will result in a more successful
improvised performance if we focus on performing with combining existing
ideas rather than creatively trying to produce a whole new idea during a
performance.

So back to the subject of this email, I see two modes of livecoding
performance - one where livecoders work within their language and
another where they work harder and try to expand it.  The latter isn't
always desirable.

Must dash but hope this email makes some sense...

It's a bit off-topic but I think the real problem is that checking fragile
stuff in seperately at the "fragile stuff" counter doesn't mean a thing;
it'll just come rolling off the belt at the point of arival most of the time
anyway.

To get back on topic; if they do keep up the most recent wave of hysteria
and indeed make people check in laptops.... Some artists put a MIDI keyboard
in their tewch-rider. This makes sense since they are quite universal as
well as impractical to travel with, a bit like turntables (appologies to
those who are in love with a speciffic model of hamer-action keyboard). For
laptops this generally makes little sense because most laptop artists depend
on speciffic software as well as their prepared samples.

Now it gets funny; theoretically all we need is a (often free)
parser/compiler. Wouldn't tech-ridering a computer put even more emphasis on
the live and improvised aspects of livecoding?

Hi Alex,

this is a good line of thought. The incremental process of livecoding 
really is what makes it an act of public reasoning.

I think what comes up here is the notion of a "livecoding piece". The 
nice thing about a piece is that it can be played by many different 
people, each time different and in its own way special. I would 
suggest that a livecoding piece is a piece of code, together with a 
number of simple rules what to do, much like a fluxus piece or a 
conceptual artwork. At times the code can be absent, or the rules can 
be. In a private interactive programming session, I often start from 
scratch, but there is no reason why not to start with a piece of code 
when doing a performance. Excuse the comparison, but it might be a 
good show to build a guitar on stage and then play a song on it, but 
it is by no means the only possible way to do a guitar concert.

(
a = [];
f = {|freq|
	a = a.addFirst ({ SinOsc.ar(freq) * AmpCompA.ir(freq) * 0.01 }.play);

hello all.

i'm not sure analogies with traditional performance modes are useful,
because ultimately, livecoding is equivelent to a composer coming on
stage and sitting down to write a piece of music while everyone
watches, and maybe with some musicians looking over his/her shoulder
playing what is being written... it just doesn't work, its an entirely
different paradigm.

i think the "in-the-zone" semi-hypnotic state that all programmers are
surely familiar with is just as valid as the focus of a performance as
the "flow" you might feel when playing the guitar. very different, but
equally valid.

there seems to be a lot of work being done in academia in creating
more intuitive controllers for electronic music, with comparisons
constantly being drawn with traditional acoustic instruments. but i
think the post-digital aesthetic works best when the focus is on the
laptop rather than a human performer. thats what draws me to
livecoding - the performer just guides the machine, letting algorithms
largely do their own thing.

i'd be interested to know how "interactive" the programs people here
are writing are.. slub quote from fallt website:

"Computer languages allow us fine-tuned expression. First, we mould a
unique sound environment in code; then, human movement transforms and
guides the musical processes in realtime"

what form does the human movement take? are parameters in the program
mapped to various sliders etc? so this means there are basically two
types of change in a livecoding performance - parameter changes
(quantitave changes of values in the system) and altering the program
itself (qualitative change - a change in the behaviour of the system
itself).

sorry if these are obvious questions (i'm new). previously i've just
concentrated on making the system in its entirety pre-performance, so
that all thats left to do during performance is alter parameters.

for me jitlib certainly offers this flexibility.  i just need adapt and

yes but rehearsal is still the key.  as opposed to preparation i think. 
  in previous gigs i found that if i had planned or prepared code to 
copy&paste, it was not only an excuse to play it [falsely] safe but 
also quickly got me into a mess.  as the code snippets weren't freshly 
coded, and under my fingers and in my mind, i forgot what they actually 
did and how i had planned to use them.  i'm not against shortcuts and 
libraries but we'd still need to practice a lot to use them.
also sharing livecode code is harder if it depends on a lot of add-ons.

yes.  but should those ideas exist as code libraries or coding habits?  
i think the latter and would again like to stress the importance of 
practice - every day for hours!  just the single month of practising 
nick and i did surely made a huge difference for me.

i think that perhaps the answer to this question lies in the freedom  
from traditional discipline that livecoding offers the performer.  
with an acoustic instrument such as a trumpet we use repetitive  
practise to internalise the range of pitches and timbres, intervals  
and rhythms, that are available to us. you can get more adventurous -  
experimenting with vocalising, half-valve fingering, circular  
breathing, hitting it with sticks etc., - but none of that means  
squat unless you can also play the flight of the bumble bee really  
fast, and hold a high c well past the time when lesser mortals would  
pass out.

[ the freesound project is always fun - http://freesound.iua.upf.edu/ 
tagsViewSingle.php?id=1412_2452 ]

perhaps the best way to express livecoding in traditional musical  
terms would be free improv played on a half-built imaginary  
instrument. as such you have to invent your own criteria for success,  
and test yourself against them. i used to play the saxophone and  
recently bought a yamaha wx7 to try to transfer the vestiges of those  
skills into a hybrid and purely computer mediated environment,  
although my lack of typing skills and mild dyslexia has pushed me  
towards bidule, which compensates for my inadequacies by letting me  
pretend that lego and sliders are coding.

however i am not finding that what i considered skills (the thought  
patterns and physical self-control that allowed me to create a set of  
pre-determined effects) are more than minimally transferrable. which  
is not to say that i can't make a noise that sounds like someone  
reasonably competent making a noise using computers!  but i have  
ended up with no criteria for success that i find convincing.

i read a research paper recently which suggested that in default of  
any other way to judge the value of something the naive observer will  
tend to estimate the amount of effort that has been put into making  
it, more being better. an expert would i expect look at something and  
think, 'in the circumstances remarkably little effort seems to have  
been expended in achieving that remarkably difficult thing. but then,  
if like me you are a fan of minimalist pop music, you might be  
searching for the very easy thing that is just remarkably good at  
pushing the pleasure buttons. i'm very interested in alex's idea that  
doing less in performance might result in more of something, and that  
doing more is not necessarily a desirable end in itself.

Not less in performance necessarily.  I was suggesting we (as
livecoders) do less inventing and more exploring what we have already
invented.

Subject: Re: [livecode] modes of livecoding


sorry, been off email for a while, can't resist catching up with a few 
quick responses.

>(alex) *a livecoding performance is not necessarily profoundly creative*

If I read this right, the same charge can be given to much over rehearsed 
traditional musical performance. The stylistic bounds of music making are 
often quite constrained, and live coding in many circumstances has a 
potentially wider palette (though its still hard to avoid falling into 
common cliches, easy to code formulations and simpler styles etc- this is 
why you also need practice to cultivate a wider repertoire).

Yet I guess I will repeat again about algorithmic thinking and engagement 
as being a novel experience for audience and performer. And I'd like to 
think that there is some genuine and profound creativity possible if you go 
deeper into the maths and the musical mappings. Live maths explorations, 
live sonification adventures, all sorts of alternative creativities to the 
musclebound valleys.

>(thor) a livecoder without a computer could be a pretty miserable thinker

Live coding doesn't require computers necessarily. See the Click Nilson 
text piece? There is also a game I've been playing with livecode debate 
audiences where I take a piece of paper to an audience member labelled:

Take this piece of paper to another audience member after modifying this 
instruction.

>(fredrik) wonder why it's so hard with discipline when it comes to 
coding...

perhaps we can't automate it so much, and keeping conscious of everything 
all the time is inherently more tiring.

>(alex) Like bum notes, syntax errors can be avoided with practice

Hmm, sometimes bum notes become acceptable hallmarks of a style, and the 
development of live coding styles through our errors might be quite fun. 
You can't play everything right. And glitch and live coding go well 
together.

overall:

I'm happy to concede that acoustic instrumental performance and live coding 
are just different, and each interesting. And I'm with those who see 
absorption and flow as possible in both situations.

For practice purposes, improvisation frameworks like Julian suggests are 
good templates to develop. On this theme, maybe overall form needs more 
discussion- this was one thing I liked about the Impromptu performances 
from the Andrews I saw in July- they had genuinely thought about framing 
their performance over time, and still allowing themselves some space to 
improvise.

hi,
here are rendered mp3s of my recent practising sessions.  music quality 
varies...
http://www.fredrikolofsson.com/music/livecodePractice-aug06/

they're all coded from scratch (synthesis, patterns etc) in ~1hour 
using plain jitlib.  the sourcecode is available here...  (you might 
need to copy&paste or select all to see it as i accidentally colorised 
all the documents)
http://swiki.hfbk-hamburg.de:8888/MusicTechnology/818
so rather than listening to the static mp3s above, i'd recommend to 
download supercollider and play [with] the code.

i think i've identified two problems.  first the getting-started and 
then the getting-on-when-you-finally-got-started.
in the beginning there's always the empty document... uhu.  so setting 
up a little task to solve or having an idea of some soundscape i'd like 
to create seemed to help.  it was usually ideas like use fm-synthesis 
today or make soft drone sounds tonight.  still, many times it started 
out sounding just awful and i got more and more stressed trying fix it. 
  anyone recognise this feeling?  ;-)  but pulling some tricks (usually 
distortion or delay effects :-) and focusing in on a few details - 
muting other sounds - i think i managed shape all the code to become 
somewhat okey sounding in the end.  i only reset the clock and started 
all over from scratch twice.
and then when i got nice processes going, it has been hard to let go of 
that and continue with something different.  so the resulting music 
above is most often just a single 'theme' or process.  i feel i'd have 
to rehears a lot more to be able to do abrupt form changes or to have 
multiple elements to build up bigger structures over time with.  i soft 
of got stuck in the a of the aba form.  it would've been nice to go 
abac etc.  perhaps that the 1h time limit made you reluctant to start 
something new 45minutes in as that'd have probably been left hanging.

but these 1hour sessions has mostly been lots of fun.  recommended and 
i'd be up for another practising duel for october.  anyone?

per recent discussion here - i don't agree with thor in that livecoding 
should lack the instant feedback you'd get from physical instrument.  
in many of the later sessions i felt like i was in total control over 
the sounds and where the music was going - at least for parts of the 
practising time.  sometimes it was enough changing just one discrete 
parameter, other times i kept re-coding say an lfo to take different 
shapes - great fun and the feedback was absolutely quick and direct.  
(although maybe not as predicable as a real instrument all the time.  
randomness, syntax errors and brain farts added to the sounds.  but 
humans are brilliant in auto adapting and making them crazy sounds 
their own.  (or quickly find excuses like: yes i _really wanted to 
distort everything here right now ;-))

On reflection trying to make a cohesive book (as opposed to group of

I am talking with Jim Prevett of Access Space in Sheffield, they are

The Language for Conversational Computing (LCC) sounds interesting:

"The statement syntax of LCC stems from that of Algol 60 and JOSS, but
LCC has been designed to exploit as fully as possible the dynamic nature
of conversational computing. Thus LCC is a fully interpretive system
with extensive features for conversational control and with capabilities
for dynamic block structure, block expressions, and recursion,
interspersed editing and execution (use of program text as data and vice

and creation (program-directed program preparation). The complete LCC
syntax and a sample conversation are included."

this sounds a bit like the test driven programming method, where you writ=

the all the tests first (sometimes this is done by another programmer),
then when all the tests pass you've finished. this is the reverse of how
most people do it, but it's much more effective.

loose ends has a much nicer sound to it though :)

this seems to be almost a full description of interactive programming:



	1.	The program text, being under direct execution, is 
understood to be "immediately" subject to change and hence the system 
statements, known as editing statements, are part of the language. 
Put another way, the text is data of the language.
	2.	The order of text entry, i.e., its creation, need not 
be as rigid as that required by most translation systems; indeed, the 
order is irrelevant.
	3.	The scope of identifiers and the definition of a 
procedure can be much more dynamic.
	4.	The states of program modification and execution can 
be interlaced flexibly.
	5.	Program variables may naturally take on values of 
different types during different stages of execution.
	6.	The system can arrange the execution of program parts 
in protected environments.

More effective at what?  Again, it might be useful for strictly designed
business logic, but can be a disaster in creative programming where
aberration is desirable.  Personally I find this kind of approach
dehumanising, particularly for the programmer who has to write the
sourcecode against the tests.  It seems a good approach for industrial
programming and for bug fixing though.

> loose ends has a much nicer sound to it though :)

I think it's also a very different approach, more like placeholders in
jitlib (correct me if I'm wrong - I've never used jitlib).  Loose ends
allow you to build a program from nothing and have it active without
being structurally complete (from my brief reading it seems that the
program pauses if it finds a loose end, waiting for the programmer to
write that bit).  Programming to pre-written tests is all about
achieving some pre-defined ideal, and you always have to have a
structurally complete program to run the tests against.

Yes, I think that is similar. The basic idea of this type of delayed 
evaluation is that programming is the composing of structures that do 
calculations (like generators, or abstract functions), instead of 
doing the calculations straight away. A closure (like in LISP) is 
something like this already, since you can bind the arguments later. 
The problem is that the whole structure must be calculated again when 
you change the bindings. The proxies in jitlib are placeholders that 
do this binding dynamically, so their graph can be recomposed at 
runtime.

tests are great to learn to understand what the role of a certain 
type of object is. But apart from this, as you say, they don't 
guarantee anything.

I have the one from the History of Programming Languages, that goes

early history..

Agreed although I guess that was in the context of generative music, and
to me livecoding is a bit more interesting than generative music.
Speaking generally, generative music is aimless drifting within fixed
boundaries defined by rules, whereas livecoding allows the both the
rules defining the boundaries and the rules defining movement within
those boundaries to be changed, on-line.

I mean, live coding is 'unfinished' in a less mundane sense than a
generative music piece is 'unfinished.'

Actually, it was in reference to the line between the "producer" and the
"consumer" blurring.


Eno observed that people were releasing up to 20 mixes and versions of song=
s
and predicted (this is in 95) that soon people would release "construction
kits" instead. He was also referring to consumers having more playback
options on modern hi-fi systems ("jazz club" presets and so on).

I think this can be extended to Livecoding quite well. Ableton Live or a
groovebox (or a guitar for that matter) are "unfinished" as a performance
and need the addition of musical elements/settings/etc. Supplying those and
thus finishing it is the performance.

As tools themselves they are are finished though (or can be seen as such,
one is still free to add different strings or plugins).

Programing languages are "unfinished" on a different level.

This is nothing new, just a perspective that struck me as interesting. You
could debate wether Live or Lisp are more or less interactive. We clearly
have our opinion but I also think millions of performers will experience
Live as more interactive. It's more immediately clear that Lisp is far more
"unfinished".

This sounds very negative but aimless drifting might be what you want,
for example it suits the purpose of ambient music very well.  The
problem I have is when generative artists equate aimless drifting within
fixed bounds with unbounded creativity.

Yeah, but I understand completely. I was quite surprised with this little
book myself for similar reasons.

Absolutely. "interactive" is a terrible word, I fully agree there and Eno
seems to agree with both of us. "unfinished" doesn't quite seem to cover
what is generally meant either. More often "adaptable" might be meant? For
digital instruments the best you can hope for is perhaps "expressive". The
aim as I see it often isn't "interaction" at all and instead it's
"expression". The instrument isn't supposed to stand opposite to or beside
the musician but ideally extend him.

It's not at all clear to to me why that word gets used. It's not like there
is a great abundance of non-configurable digital applications that would be
considered for musical expression.

I have been considering making or adapting a sequencer that would "get
bored" if some element was left static for too long and that would start
changing such elements on it's own. That's still extremely low level and not
"interactive" according to your suggested definition by a long stretch but
on the other hand I imagine it would make many musicians quite nervous and
annoyed.

I don't think the general market for musical programs wants "interaction" at
all in that sense but I might be wrong.

I agree very much, especially if it's a performance context.

One of the tricky bits if of course that Livecoding results in "generative
music" in that musical elements literally follow from rules; defining the
rules is the performance.
Hopefully we would have specific aims but even then; writing rules that
results in us accomplishing our aims is quite hard.

It's quite often that I see laws result in behaviour quite different from
what the aims were.

just for curiosity (I think understand the weird feeling you have with it):
why do you think interactivity is a terrible word? Because of its 
meaning or its (mis-?)use? Would you say that interactive is the 
opposite of expressive, even?

Interactive is unfortunately most often used in the meaning of reactive: I 
push a button and the machine does this. A fixed mapping, which can be 
effective and useful, but is not interactive.
Interactive would be that the machine may have a different response depending 
on the situation, past and so on.

Expressive is yet another dimension. Expressivity can be reached both by 
reactive and interactive systems.

Marije

     Yeah! In the Smalltalk community, we often refer to what we do as
"exploratory programming" and even "improvisatory programming". So
livecoding resonated strongly and immediately with me.

     Debugging things into existence (without ever having to restart) is
a lovely way of life. :)

Indeed, this what I was aiming at.

I'd go further, I'm inclined to follow Alex and require some amount of
equalness; at least the possibility of the interactive application taking
some sort of initiative. I might tap the numlock key twice rapidly to ask a
computer weather it's "awake" but typically my computers don't flash "hey,
are you still there?" on the screen.

Context-dependant responses as such aren't quite enough on their own to me.
My laundry machine will react on the "on" button in a way that depends on
it's current state (being wether it's already on) but I wouldn't call it
"interactive" at all (and typically those machines are nice exactly because
they save interaction about doing the laundry!)

I'm hesitant to go as far as Alex because to me playing with a dog gets
across as interactive but the dog (probably? hopefully?) doesn't approach m=
y
intelligence but I suppose that depends on how you see that scale.

My main issue comes from "interactive" turning into a buzz-word and I think
this is what Eno was aiming at as well since he seems quite concerned about
"interactive CD-roms". "Interactive" has come to (often) mean that there is
a set of pleasingly implemented options, preferably operated by a mouse.

Expressive is yet another dimension. Expressivity can be reached both by
> reactive and interactive systems.



Quite so, I didn't mean to imply they ruled each other out or were dependan=
t
in some way, I'm just getting the impression that "interactive" is often
meant to imply "expressive" but that often all you get is the possibility t=
o
explore what option results in what reaction.

I suspect marketing departments like mixing those up because "expressive"
depends largely on the user and thus is harder to sell.

yes, I would generally agree with you on that - but I think there is some
worth in examining and comparing the methods of professional programming,
if only because a huge amount of effort has been expended thinking about
how people think and build things.

I think it's interesting to acknowledge the fact that we tend to write
programs in this nonlinear order - ie leaving undone bits to come back to
later, forgetfully, and not in an order which keeps it runnable all the
time.

i thought to be distinct by now but anyway... there was one interesting 
detail among the cheesy light and videoprojections - they showed their

bloke).  they hardly moved and you could not see what or if they played 
as their hands were hidden behind the synths.  right behind them they 
had one huge biggest possible model flatscreen each.  those were all 
showing different virtual synths or patch editors.  once in a while you 
could see them flip through windows and scoll to load patches.  
unfortunately the text was too small to read and didn't recognise any 
of the programs in use.  but it was all pretty awkward.  after 40 years 
they've seemed to have discovered something lacking from their show and 
a way to compensate for it.

So we might consider it a misuse: inter- in the sense of several 
flowers in the same pot (old french: enterrer: buried into the 
earth). This would make the internet something like a family grave 
for posthumans.

But yes: looking up the word "interact": act reciprocally, mutually. 
In the sense of borrowing of each other, creating something common to 
the participants.

>Expressive is yet another dimension. Expressivity can be reached both by

I was being a bit ironic about a kind of instrument that is only 
interactive for the sake of making you express yourself to someone 
else. But well, no problem with this..

hi craig
hehe, please do!  i'd love that pressure ;-)
(on my darker days i wish everyone producing music should be faced with 
a trial like this.  then perhaps we wouldn't suffer all this 
meaningless crap music surrounding us)
and for reference - the music thursday sounded a lot like the live clip 
'live in Brussels/Belgium 1997' here...
http://tangerinedream.org/mod.php?mod=userpage&menu=1402&page_id=7
i do like their early stuff but this kind of music is nearly 
incomprehensible to me and i find it truly ugly.  shrug.

anyway - getting back on topic - maybe showing the software editors is 
a sort of a substitute for the nestling patchcords in the analogue 
days?  tech is part of their concept and the tools is the message.  and 
they are happy to show them.
i think performing live coding on stage has great deal of this.  the 
tech fetishism.  is that something to try to avoid or part of the 
deal/fun i wonder...

I thought about that too but there are differences. When you had images of a
musician in the 60s posing with a impressive array of instruments this had a
differend context then showing a softsynth interface now.

For one thing those intruments were well out of the reach of the audience
finantially and I think some of the apeal came from it not being quite clear
how they worked or what was done with them. For many "synthesiser music"
recordings of that period this may be quite fornunate because IMHO many
hardly go beyond the stage of demonstrating what a arpegiator does. Of
cource there is fetishim; the performers themselves seem quite impressed by
the instruments and base fundamental parts of their compositions on features
of those.

I think livecoding, even if it indeed also glorifies the tool, is different
in that we are actively trying to break down the mystery of the instrument
in order to show the performance itself. Wether we are being sucessfull in
this so far and indeed wether it has any chance of success at all is another
matter but I feel it's worth trying.


I would argue that the tech fetshism of the 60's and 70's depended at least
in part on the instruments being hard to obtain while livecoding at the very
least *benefits* from the tools being free as well as open. If SC or ChucK
or similar systems would cost 10.000$ and require a handmade laptop as well
as depend on employing a engineer the situation would be quite differend.

The people that I know that were around back then and listened to that music
all tell about a longing for those unobtainable instruments was a part of
it. Our instruments for the most part are freely available to anybody who
cares to download them. I think showing schreens is different if they
audience has the option of going home and imediately and for free try their
own hand at it. For one thing I suspect it would lead to them paying more
atention of that option is there.


In the case of Tangerine Dream and Vorhaus performing now and showing their
schreens I think it's a different sort of tech-fetishism then posing with a
Buchla or Moog. Even if Vaz and similar systems aren't free, they are at
least generally avaible and within the reach of nearly everybody.

A different question is intention; did Vorhaus realise there was a good
chance people in the audience would know Vaz? Did he think about what it
would mean to those when no automated knobs or moving mouse pointers were
seen? I have no answers there, I'm a bit mystified by it, especially since
White noise wasn't -to my knowledge- too big on posing for photos at all,
with or without instruments. I don't knwo enough about Tangine Dream to
comment on them.

I think livecoding retains a small element of this, although it is  
not about financial attainability, but rather the mistaken perception  
that programming is something most people cannot engage with. I think  
livecoding has an ability to change that by demonstrating ease of use  
- we just have to find ways of allowing audience members the  
potential to understand. This is very different to taking a didactic  
approach by trying to make _everyone_ understand (which is a mistake  
and probably would bore an audience).

Also, I strongly believe that more flashing lights and smoke machines  
would help.

About the participants:

**Wilfried Hou Je Bek (NL)

Applying scientific rigour and an eminently wide-ranging frame of
crytsalpunk reference, socialfiction.org protaganist Wilfried Hou Je
Bek plays out the expressively elegant and digressional expansion of
software across all (literalised) domains, for example algorithmic
psychogeography.

**Martin Howse (UK)

Speculative and necessarily open hardware explorer Martin Howse
proposes a denuded artistic CPU (an elaborated, auto-destructive
bachelor-culture machine) running heavily promiscuous code and
operating on a noise terrain. Latest plans include the staging of the
xxxxx research institute in Berlin.

**Jonathan Kemp (UK)
Performer, theorist, ap/xxxxx collaborator and visual artist, Jonathan Ke=
mp
applies the refined instruments of his adoptive stoneworking to excavate =
the
esoteric thought matter of characters such as Emmanuel Swedenborg and
Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz.

**Bruno Marchal (BE)
Bruno Marchal is currently occupied with refining his supremely elegant,
code-based theories of COMP at the IRIDIA AI labs in Brussels. COMP has
precise consequences, for example that physics is necessarily a branch of
computer science; the implication being that "if you were in a perfect

Yeah, I was going to ask about that; I don't understand any of it.

I hope "m" will explain what this is saying about what subject. I
particularly would like to know why this machine is so cynical. I imagine
the poor thing is unhappy about having to imitate The Theatre, I think it
would be much happier if left to do some nice math.

I quite agree. Although I do like to see The Theatre doing nice

Indeed, but then this is the double-edged-sword of livecoding. On the  
one hand were are actively attempting to demystify the process by  
being open, on the other we are making it possible for people to be  
impressed by virtuosity or bravado. I don't think the two are  
mutually exclusive; A geek coder in the audience might understand but  
still be wowed by the fact that the livecoder is using code in new  
ways, whilst the middle aged Mum next to him is wowed because she had  
no idea computers did anything other than write thank you letters in  
Word. Both have potential for enlightenment but also - as you point  
out - the key elements of a good performance.

ps. Please forgive my horrendous and unforgivable stereotypes. Of  
course, we all know our audiences will be filled with middle aged  
geek Mums who hack MS Office thank you letter macros in their spare  
time.

Could well be! I have no idea. I was writing purely from how I myself look
at it with liberal amounts of hunches. It's all quite new and perhaps in
five years livecoding will be as established as grooveboxes and it will turn
out I was wrong completely.

Oh, I agree. I don't agree with all those factors to the same degree but
yes.

Still, in a odd way livecoding reminds me of a thing Liszt (the composer and
pianist) did. Liszt was the first one to turn the grand piano so the
keyboard was at 90 degrees to the edge of the stage. This resulted in the
lid projecting the sound at the audience but more interestingly (to us) it
opened up his hands visually. This was quite important because some people
considdered his music to be completely unplayable after just seeing the
sheet music.

In a way I think showing the schreen is similar to Liszt showing his hands.
This may have taken something from the "how did he do that?" factor but I
also think it's generally established that Liszt still had one of the
largest "wow factors" in musical history.

I think the "how did he do that?" thing has gotten quite damaged by some
laptop musicians where the correct answer is "he didn't". Liszt, unlike us,
didn't have the option of working with a backing track in secret. What
apeals to me in livecoding is the inherent honesty, unlike in many
performances of electronic music there is no option to cheat. There may
still be a "how did he do that?" element; I know I think "how did he do
that?" about code quite often, hopefully I'll go "ah, that's clever!" soon
afterwards...

I have a suspicion that for a good livecoding performance you'd need to be a
very good coder as well as a very focused sort of person, a quick thinker
and so on and that this in itself might be impressive enough, maybe actually
more impressive the more clear it is what's going on.


  at least i know i prefer to get tricked or
> confused instead of 'taught' something.


Sure, to some degree but I think I'd be disapointed with a fake interperter
and fake code to mime to a minidisk after the first time I saw it (the first
time would admittedly be quite funny).

Maybe, but that holds everywhere. Many regular musical pieces, from Liszt to
hair-metal have passages that are so fast and complicated that even if you
know the intstrument being played very well you still couldn't fully grasp
every note.

Ok, that might be a misunderstanding. I wasn't saying anyone should preach.
I agree with most of the points of the open source movement but the
discussion is very boring to me, particularly because many of those it's
aimed at don't want to be in that discussion at all. Livecoding, or for that
matter any sort of creative coding, only makes sense if you enjoy the
process. I think it has the added apeal of being open and honest about
exactly what's happening to the audience but I'm not at all in favour of
beating the poor audience over the head with that concept verbally. If it's
not clear on it's own it might not even be preceived as true anyway.

Oh, sure, I think so too, I don't think there's any conflict between the
two. Still, I believe that it would stil be interesting if it would ever
catch on and wouldn't be weird anymore but that's pure specualtion.


I don't think we disagree at all, at least I don't disagree with what you
said; as for my other points I completely prepared to be shown wrong; it
should be exciting to see how that stuff develops.

Paganini was quite a blast too - he used to break his strings so he

Unless the entire machine is visible then there will always be an  
option to hide some of the processes that produce the output. There's  
an interesting idea here about what lies behind the interface; I  
think a piano would have to try very hard to be dishonest. Once you  
press the key it has very little option but to hit the string!

Yes, but  when positioning the piano in the pre-Liszt way you would now have
the option of using some modern MIDI controlled player-piano. As long as you
are showing your hands it will stick out when there are far more notes then
what you are playing.

...Or maybe not. When instruments are featured in movies the manual gestures
often have very little relationship to the notes heard. To get back to
Paganini; this happens to a rather disturbing degree in Kinsky's movie on
him (I advise against seeing that, BTW). Most of the time the average viewer
doesn't complain and maybe doesn't notice.

Anyway, I recognise this but this is why I mentioned that I thought general
availability for livecoding systems was a pre. If you were to give a
livecoding performance in SuperCollider you have a chance that somebody in
the audience will know the language and will start getting restless as soon
as some musical element is introduced that aparently has nothing to do with
the code you wrote so far. If you were to do one in PSandersCode version
0.0.3(in-house alpha) which might have loads and loads highly unusual and
hard to understand functions this risk would be much smaller.

To be clear; I'd still love to see performances in unusual home-brew
languages, I just think that on a prinicple level generally available
systems fit with how I read the Toplap manifesto.
 I still think that somebody who feels his homebrew and hard to understand
langauage is the most expressive thing available to him should immediately
go perform in that language; it's his performance, not mine. I didn't object
when I heard that Unit Moebius prefered performing from teh backstage using
very long audo cables either.

Subject: [livecode] physicality and live coding 


[warning- one thing below in particular is ethically dubious but 
interesting to suggest...]

I thought I might set down a few ideas I had the other day concerning this 
reoccurring issue of the physical.

Not to anticipate too much I hope, but my current conclusion remains that 
live coding and conventional instrumental control are simply different, and 
should be celebrated for that.

But as with all such sweeping categorisations, there is murky artistic fun 
to be had in the middle?

Physical results after coding
Errors-> physical punishment.
Beethoven's father would strike his hands with a ruler if he made mistakes 
while practising. I suggest electric shocks applied to the programmer 
linked to syntax errors or bugs of certain graded seriousness (obviously 
linked to pain). A full system crash would be matched with death for the 
programmer from a loaded pistol, or drop them from a great height as a 
trapdoor opens, thus incorporating a real concert tightrope.

Physical coding
Tangible computing and sign languages, jumping
The performer dictates a program in sign language. The performer plays with 
some tangible computing interface. The performer jumps around a symbol mat, 
etc

Physical data as an input
Posture->sonification
The data to be sonified is the position of the live coder at their desk, as 
they unconsciously slump, fidget, fail to move an eyelid etc.

Direct physical control
Typing notes is trivial, but uninteresting for a live coder (it is very 
interesting for a pianist, I'm not against note control!). This is the only 
exemplar of note-level control with live coding, the rest is score-level, 
as described in many sources on interactive music systems (see David 
Wessel's work for instance). We can argue about the score-code analogies, 
but I don't see any way around the failure to specify note by note with 
direct feedback control.

There are levels of abstraction that don't have a physical analogue, and 
this is a fundamental brickwall we shouldn't beat ourselves up against. It 
is an inherent 'price' of live coding that directness is exchanged for 
greater abstract power.

One remaining speculation:
However, I think we can deal with automaticity, just not note-level 
control. Musicians learn to automate many physical actions because they 
otherwise could not control everything at once (this is why they have very 
developed cerebellums in neuro-imaging studies!). There is no reason that a 
machine assistant could not help us to automate coding tasks. Think of 
going beyond auto-completion into auto-prediction. I might train up a 
system on my August live coding exercises, then let it try to anticipate 
what I will type far ahead. Of course, this is a blue-sky scheme which will 
be semantically lacking for the usual reasons of advanced AI etc. But it is 
one avenue of investigation for interesting live coding work- and could 
remain an optional component of a performance system, to be grabbed if 
necessary if you need to speed up your responses. You could train up over 
many rehearsals with acoustic musicians, linking automated audio analysis 
to code snippets...getting gradually faster?

[the last paragraph is very speculative, and I'd also suspect such 
artificial automaticity might undermine the interesting side of live coding 
where your conscious algorithmic thought is the focus. Nothing wrong with 
practicing fast thinking however, and there are some mathematical 
automations surely possible- back to practice again!)

Hi,

one thing I always held for absolutely necessary for live coding is that you 
should turn on the internal mic of the laptop, so that at least you can hear 
the typing of the live coder.
(that, and I would oblige every live coder to acquire some proper typing 
skills. Nothing so frustrating as being a fast thinker, but not a fast enough 
typer).

I got a proof of concept working using hs-plugins, triggering sounds
using an OSC library taken from the HSC supercollider client
  http://www.slavepianos.org/rd/f/207949/
  http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/hs-plugins/

Proof of the proof of concept:
  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLS6GHXWMpA

My disorganised source:
  http://yaxu.org/hs/

Now I'm pre-occupied with the far more difficult task of learning
haskell properly...  Then I hope to make a nice haskell DSL for making
music.  Am very happy to discuss this further anyway.

I'm a bit confused about how haskell's laziness and monads helps/impacts
on livecoding...

It's a beautiful language, I encourage others to take a look.

I'd be interested to hear about this, esp. about the difference to 
sc, which is also stateless in its pattern/ugen graph definitions.

I've been meaning to spend some time getting to know erlang, which seems
to oftem be mentioned alongside haskell. The interesting thing about
erlang is that it's designed for "hot swapping" parts in and out of a
running system, is Haskell similar to this?

Related partly to that, something else I was looking at today was this:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Oriented_Assembly_Lisp
Which also has modification of a running process built into it's design:

  "It's astonishing at how much this ability changes your coding style
   - you gravitate to a much more iterative development process, and
   write small bits of code that evolve the codebase while the game is
   running.  It's obviously also much better for robustness and
   reliability, because you're testing out each little piece of code
   as it gets added (as opposed to writing a whole mess of code and
   trying to get it compiled and debuggged).  As for bugs, often you
   can fix them while the game is running and test out your changes
   instantly - this makes bugfix verification much easier. "

Well I'm not the best person to answer although I'm also trying to learn
supercollider properly.  I can say though that Haskell somehow allows
you to have state and imperative style programming through the power of
monads.  Monads are central to haskell, quite straightforward, yet
rather difficult to fully grasp.  So I really can't talk about them any
more than this.  But somehow they allow you to cleanly separate
sequenced interactions with the messy world from the pure, far more
reasonable functional part of your program, by assuming the monadic
laws.  

Maybe Mikael can expand on and correct all the mistakes in the above...

Not as standard although there is the hs-plugins module that might help
towards that way of thing.  I've seen erlang mentioned a lot but didn't
know about this feature, something like smalltalk I guess?  But yes,
very interesting...

Nice!  I also want to look at Prolog, which also seems dynamic.

Well, the description basically matches my own understanding of it as 
well. I'm a relative Haskell newbie myself, but approaching the language 
from the hardcore mathematical point of view -- viewing category theory as 
the natural thing and Haskell as an expression of it.

>From the perspective of category theory, a monad is "just a thing 
fulfilling these axioms", and you can (with some luck and the right 
teacher) boil it down to that a monad is something you can "colour" your 
objects (~ Haskell types) with. The funky part then is that whenever 
you've coloured an object twice, there is a canonical way (part of the 
Monad axioms) to remove one layer of colouring.

The first and most obvious instance -- from the category theoretical / 
operad theoretical point of view of a monad is the List monad. Something 
lives in the List monad if it actually lives in a tensor product of 
objects of the category you work in -- so in Haskell language if it 
actually IS a list of thingies. The associativity of the tensor product 
gives the colour-reduction map -- and in Haskell language this translates 
to a map taking [[a,v,c],[b,e],[e,f,a,d,y,g,h]] -> 
[a,v,c,b,e,e,f,a,d,y,g,h]; flattening the list. Among operad theorists 
(which is where I first encountered Monads...), the Monads grow funky 
because you can use them to characterize "composition" much more smoothly: 
there is an operad consisting of non-overlapping arrangements of circles 
of various sizes within the unit circle. This can be expressed as a monad 
of an appropriate sort. And as a result, you can include the monad chosen 
in the formalism, and get a smoother way to handle the properties of the 
thingies.

But this is all quite far from the livecoding aspects otoh...

Wow!  Well I really love the language, despite only imagining what it's
like to write things in it.  

The obvious question is, can bol2 be used interactively?  Another, are
you going to be talking near London at all?

As an aside, I had an idea while reading the documentation and papers
around bol2, of an onomatopoeic synthesiser.  Instead of sending a midi
note to such a synthesiser you could just send a string of text, such as
"krrrnnk!" or "booooeee?"  Much like a speech synthesiser but the aim
wouldn't be to make understandable phonetic speech, but rather a simple,
learnable mapping between arrangements of letters and sounds.  It would
seem a natural way for specifying diverse sounds very quickly in a
controlled manner.  It seems a fairly obvious idea but I couldn't
immediately find reference of anything similar existing.

Yes although if we don't have the need to replicate human speech we have
much wider options for the sounds we can make.

I could do with knowing more about semiotics here, but instead of having
a word that represent a sound, we can have the certain arrangement of
letters within the words represent the structure of a sound, and then
rearrange the letters to make a new sound.  Speech synthesis is geared
towards translating words from one domain to another, so when you tell
it to synthisise kknnrnarlgn, it doesn't work.  Or does it?  My
experiences with the festival speech synth have been disappointing
anyway.  Maybe all that needs to be done is removing some of the
limitations from the software...

But again considering the bol processor, if we aren't modelling human
speech we can do things like 

kknnnr{aarghh,ooooooh}scshknk!??! , where the aarghh and ooooooh parts

I also think this would make a great project, both fun for the user, and a 
potentially highly audience-accessible 'live coding' tool (not necessarily 
with a full language element). Yet if somehow you devised a programming 
language of onomatopoeias

utter = ow + aargh!

which both were sonified as code as typed and themselves generated more 
onomatopoeic code...

For generative strings of noise wordiness I start to think of Dave's long 
tokens of GA generated functions.

On the research precedence issue, there are bound to be some, that's the 
way of research life with all those clever active humans around, but 
perhaps not anything exactly the same; I can't think of such a project off 
hand.

There are plenty of electroacoustic pieces and voice works that use 
nonsense words and deliberately evocative sound words to paint, from Ligeti 
Aventures, Swedish tape/vocal music of the 60s, Lansky's Idle Chatter etc.

The machine learning part be a great way to personalise the synthesiser to 
your own favoured sounds, though collating any database of ground truth 
might be unwieldy; using existing speech synthesisers as Julian suggests 
would be one shortcut. You might also look into 70s style nonstandard 
synthesis as making a language for converting token strings into basic 
synthesis operations (see Roads Computer Music Tutorial).

`----------------------'

We're after PEOPLE DOING STRANGE THINGS WITH ELECTRICITY to show us
their work at dorkbotlondon.

If you haven't been along yet, dorkbotlondon is an informal get together
where a few people show their projects and ideas to a dorkcrowd of
artists who want to be engineers and vice-versa, ranging from 30 to 100
people.  We're a friendly, interested bunch so the less polished and
more unusual your presentation the better.  It could just be some idea
you have, some software bug you've exploited or some dorky electronics
you've repurposed.  It just needs to be STRANGE and involve ELECTRICITY
in some way.  That's generally means electronics or software is
involved, but why not push the boundaries?

How long you present is up to you - from 5 to 10 mins (opendork style)
to 20 or 40 minutes (schedule permitting).  We can usually fit you in to
the next dorkbot, but if not, almost always the one after that.

Maybe you've been to dorkbotlondon a few times and have a project you've

Greetings,
Is this an acceptable forum for discussing architectural options for  
implementing livecoding systems?

In particular, I'm thinking of building one of my own, and I'm trying  
to figure out what my options are, in particular regarding managing  
time.

Is the Unix "interval timer" good enough? What makes "good enough" --  
is the main issue jitter? What's a good way of measuring jitter with  
reasonably high resolution?

Since I'm going to be doing this on MacOS X, what about using NSTimer  
or the RunLoopTimer?  Alternatively, should I consider building my  
livecoding system as a kernel module and using the real-time  
facilities provided to device drivers?

Apologies if this isn't the right forum, and suggestions of where to  
take it are welcome.

Others will have better technical advice than me, but in my experience
if you have a few things playing at the same time, timer inaccuracy
becomes unimportant (as long as all the things are differently
inaccurate.  Slightly fumbled timing adds character anyway, so I tell
myself.

What is more important in my view is syncing with other people, and
without talking about MIDI, as far as I know there is no operating
system/application neutral standard way of doing that.  I'd like to hear
about it if there was, and have long wanted to collaborate on
formalising something OSC based.  Has no one done that yet?

Livecoding inside the kernel, wow!

Also timing related - has anyone built these kinds of performance rules

I don't know if it's a common approach (I made a lot of this stuff up as =
I
went along) but I find running the interpreter you are livecoding a secon=
d
or so ahead of the audio backend. It helps to keep things stable and mean=
s
the interpreter doesn't have to run in a realtime thread. The latency
doesn't really matter if you're programming. This has changed with my
current setup which graphically displays thread positions, but nobody
seems to notice yet.

I use posix gettimeofday() for non realtime timing, and sample counting
from the audio card on the realtime thread - this is probably the Wrong
Way, but it's the only way of doing it I could think of and seems to work
for me.

If you're talking about generating sounds, then I don't think using  
CFRunLoopTimer (which is toll-free bridged to NSTimer, so it's the  
same thing anyway) will give you good enough results. Or, atleast, if  
it was good enough on one machine then you couldn't be sure it would  
be on another. It's not realtime, as you know.

I count audio samples from my IOProc and use that to derive a time to  
which all sounds and events are synced. I'm fairly confident that  
CoreAudio is consistent once it gets going but I have noticed a  
little bit of oddity. Sometimes in the first few milliseconds of  
operation, CoreAudio uses a lower sampling rate until it ramps up to  
the desired one. My understanding of this is a bit sketchy but I  
think it has to do with the way CoreAudio optimises itself to reduce  
latency. So you lose a bit of accuracy in the first few frames of  
your audio, but in the long run CoreAudio should be very precise and  
responsive.

Anyway, funky music is never properly synchronised anyway.

Actually, this is exactly the kind of thing I had in mind, which is  
why a solid jitter-free timing base is important.  I can't control

Hi Dylan

You didn't say if your livecoding system is going to be controlling 
synthetic audio, or other stuff (MIDI, lights, robot dancers etc)...

But if you're controlling your own audio system then the obvious choice is 
the audio sample clock.. no scope for perceptible event jitter there unless 
buffers get dropped. you could run your scripts in the audio thread.. (SC1) 
or queue timestamped events in a "jitter buffer" and dequeue them after a 
delay longer than the longest expected timing jitter in your audio 
callback... (SC3)

There's a few pretty pictures in here which might get you thinking about 
timing and audio buffers...

Balls bouncing off oscillator symbols, modifying the instructions that

The problem with physics is that it isn't terribly deterministic. Because
what happens depends on floating point maths, the exact results depend on
processor, code optimisation, direction of the wind etc. Having said that=
,
it might be quite good to introduce a level of this in a live programming
language :)

I'm hatching a plan for "BetaBlocker Next-Generation Pro Deluxe Edition"
which may introduce elements of this - but probably using a simpler custo=

I just wish he had demoed the (as the credits refer to it) "Modular  
Synth Patch & Control" app by Philip Davidson [http://mrl.nyu.edu/ 
~philipd]. You can see (but unfortunately not hear) it briefly in the

Related to physics-simulation-driven sound generation, I enjoyed  
playing around with balldroppings (http://jtnimoy.net/itp/ 
balldroppings)  a while ago, and hacked together my own related  
version in Java. It generates MIDI events driven by balls hitting  
paddles in a world with gravity.  I call it Kapwing.  Check it out on  
my page http://www.mecodegoodsomeday.com

Yes I suppose I would.  It's not turing complete so I don't know if it's
fully toplap compliant though.

I've tried to perform with it twice and not had much luck...  I'd like
to persevere though if you + ade are up for it!

We're playing at fave in London, or at least I think we are (we're not

If anyone else wants to come and play (I mentioned it to Nick but forgot

Oh yeah, nothing like free knowledge.

Well - if Pd is open source, the book
should also be made online and free
very soon.

now, I'm really worried about how to make

And I couldn't see any of it :/

Mine was all from scratch too, I had some Perl scripts ready in the
wings but didn't use them.  The grammar felt easy to play with, and was
surprisingly easy to work out what was making what sound with the
semi-onomatopoeic symbols.

I used datadirt to make the actual noises (sample trigger thing written
in C) rather than supercollider.  Something is really brittle about how
I'm using supercollider, it either works perfectly or not at all.  Have
supercollider users managed to get it so they can push against the
limits and have interesting glitches without scserver or jack crashing?

yes, that was my issue with the lsystem rule coding for a while - but on
further research (mainly the formal rules as arithmetic processor in
Godel Escher Bach) it seems that even the simplest domain specific
languages can be used to express much higher level things.

hi alex.
er, with sc i think you'll need to create the glitches yourself ;-)  
emulation?  top of this page is an ugen and a class that might help...
http://www.fredrikolofsson.com/pages/code-sc.html
no seriously, sc server is a hard one to trick.  allocating big chunks 
of memory will get you some hickups but not particularly interesting as 
glitches.  on os x the server is pretty hard to crash i found.
(sc lang on the other hand has a lot to offer.  eg just opening 
helpfiles or sorting big arrays makes the timing (AppClock) all shaky.  
but you only run sc server, right?)

nice screencast btw.  keep them coming!  looking forward to seeing it 
live.

Thanks for this...  I am using sclang, haven't got far with Drape's
haskell sc bindings yet.  Maybe it's sclang that I'm crashing?  I'll
have a look later.

I think for live computer music a better failure mode is to glitch,
rather than to stop working completely.

Thanks.  Maybe let me know when you're next in London and we can set up
a TOPLAP event...  We have a PA at state51 now (thanks to no-signal.net)
so it would be easy.

if you are not depending on any ressources on the=20
server, you can quickly boot a new one if you=20
actually have managed to crash the old.

sclang is easy to crash with an infinite loop =E0=20
la: fork { loop { } } or anything that approaches=20
such a situation, but otherwise it usually is=20
pretty stable.

Alex, are you sending osc first to sclang and from there to scserver?

It's nice to finish a set with a lot of processes, perhaps even a
forkbomb, where everything slowly grinds to a halt.  It seems that this
high precision low latency stuff gets in the say of this.

> Alex, are you sending osc first to sclang and from there to scserver?

Yes although Rohan Drape has now given me a recipe to schedule events
directly on scserver with high precision.  I would then have to
implement some of these rules to make it sounds wonky again:
  http://www.speech.kth.se/music/performance/performance_rules.html

He also pointed me at the Stream, Pattern and Event model stuff in
sclang.  That really looks quite beautiful to use.  Do all the
supercollider people use that stuff?

It is using jack, which I find a really annoying, fussy piece of

yes, sure.

Many of the JITLib classes extend this scheme.=20
You can do livecoding with l-systems, e.g. using=20
Plsys:=20
http://swiki.hfbk-hamburg.de:8888/MusicTechnology/727




[1] this you could use to slowly tune the glitch:



s =3D Server.local;
s.boot;

SynthDef("numsynths",{
	SendTrig.kr(Impulse.kr(0), 0, NumRunningSynths.ir);
	Line.kr(doneAction: 2); // free self
}).send(s);


SynthDef("wastecpu",{
	var dt =3D Rand(1, 5);
	{ Line.ar(dur: dt, doneAction: 2) } ! 50; // free self
}).send(s);



(
q =3D q ? ();
q.numSynths =3D 0;
q.balance =3D 100;

// register to receive this message
OSCresponder(s.addr,'/tr',{ arg t,r,msg;
	q.numSynths =3D msg[3].postln;
}).add;


fork {
	inf.do {|i|
		if(q.numSynths < q.balance) {
			Synth("wastecpu");
		};
		Synth("numsynths");
		0.1.wait;

	}

}

)


// tune numSynths..
q.balance =3D 15;

interesting... I quite like it.

it takes a while to tune it, but I like the stability - a few years ago i=

was the only way I could find of getting live audio to work at all
(without the glitch taking over completely)

Nice, it seems a really great structure to build stuff around, I wonder
what the history of it is, whether it was inspired from other
languages/systems or imagined afresh for supercollider.

Yes, I think that's based on the excellent glitches Ade's MSG synth made

personally for me it is this: 1993 I met the mathematician Michael 
Renton in Kharimabad, a small place in the mountains of Pakistan and 
we quickly became good friends, because we couldn't solve some stupid 
riddle involving coconuts, snails and monkeys. He made his phd some 
years later in chaos theory and started working in biomathematics. A 
couple of years ago he came to Hamburg and introduced us to L-Systems 
they were (and still are) using to model tree growth. I have 
implemented this in SC then, and a while ago improved and simplified 
it so that now you can also use context-sensitive grammars. Also it 
is a lazy system now so you can stream in data from one side and 
filter it with the rules.

but of course this is not the history of l-systems..

Wow, I'm really glad to get this lovely story out of you although
actually was trying (and failing) to refer to the stream model in
supercollider and not your l-system stuff.

This kind of story is really great to know though, I wonder if there is
a similar story behind every programming library related to music.  Does
anyone else want to share the story behind the creation of their
library/environment/software?

As for re-write rules I think the next stage of my project will use
them...  Analysing livecoding of my simple grammar as re-write rules.
Well I need to read more about this stuff but I reckon looking at your
coconut, snail and monkey library will help.

The stream model in SC comes from HMSL, but of=20

Yes I gave this link here twice already the last week!

This paper has a  review of this area including some evalutation of KTH
rules:

Music Performance: The State of the Art. Journal of New Music Research

Well, as I read the pages I linked to these rules are quite straightforward
and shouldn't be that hard to implement in the sort of environment used in
livecoding.

Detecting what a "phrase" is might be hardest but clearly we could cheat and
simply define something that would generate something "phrase-like" as a
sort of unit and at that point the rest would be quite easy.

Sounds like a worthwhile area to invest a few evening in.

Heh, it was worth its own post rather than just an aside anyway, kicks
the discussion off properly...

Yes true.  It seems to be a post-processing step, so needs a bit of
buffering.

Oh yeah definitely.  I think the job is easier for generated music than
it is with post processing some MIDI file, you're really  at the source
of the music and have any information about where phrases are that there
could be.  I guess also that you could see applying these rules not just
as highlighting or 'expressing' phrases but defining where they are in
the first place.

Also there's no reason why we can't come up with our own performance
rules that a human wouldn't normally play.  Well maybe many here already
have.

Maybe, depending on the structure of your program, but for most of those I
think these rules could be incorporated into whatever generates sounds. For
many of these rules you could probably already determine wether it applies
and if so in what way at the moment the note is being generated. That's
quite fortunate because otherwise the poor aucoustical musicians would be in
deep trouble. Acoustical musicians tend to have a image of the near future
of the piece in their head already which gives them a advantage but
algorithems could be written to mimic this. One could, for example, generate
the controler data for a whole phrase every ten seconds instead of
generating a note every one second.

Exactly, that's what interests me, I'm not all that interested in treating
MIDI files. To me this field links to what I see as one of the largest
challenges in livecoding or for that matter generated music in general; it's
not that hard to write a set of rules that will generate notes (or some sort
of note-equivalent) but it's quite hard to write rules that give pleasing
results, especially over a longer time. This research at least gives some
pointers to ways of aproaching this.

Agreed, it would for example be interesting to aproach other data sets like
these people aproached (mainly) baroque, classical and jazz. At times when
hearing interesting sounds or sound paterns in non-musical contexts I've
been trying to find "rules" linked to elements that I liked but with little
sucess so far in the way of things that could be fed to a compiler. It does
get much harder when there is no score to compare things too but one
interesting aproach would be using techniques from physical modeling applied
to controler data instead of audio waves.


Sticking literally to already discovered rules doesn't realy seem in the
spirit of livecoding either...

Dear all,

I'm thinking of writing up a paper on 'live coding practice', especially 
dealing with whether we are actually getting any better at it with 
practice. I'm curious to hear any tales of punishing practising schedules, 
of personal triumphs and obstacles.

I'm sure the list would be happy to hear any salacious details, but feel 
free to also email me off list if there are private confessions...

I'm really curious to see if anyone has followed up the practice challenge 
Fredrik and I pursued in August. Are we close to abandoning live coding, is 
it just Alex working hard at it*, or are there dedicated academies 
springing up on the underground?

best
Nick

I haven't had time, still in heavy development on my new livecoding

words to waveguide synthesis.

Yes, very interested to hear what others are up to too!

The 2007 LOSS/TOPLAP thing in Sheffield *will* happen, with a related
gig in London too.  Some funding has been secured.  Perhaps that will be
a good time to recollect our thoughts and/or disband TOPLAP and form
something new :)

We need to collectively decide on a date for the Sheffield event, any
preferences?

Well, other than performing (mainly with alex) lately, I'm currently
porting fluxus to the plt scheme interpreter. The reasons for this are no=
t
entirely livecoding related, but are partly, as the drscheme IDE has some
nice ideas, for instance you can embed and use images directly as values
in the code:
http://www.plt-scheme.org/software/drscheme/tour/tour-Z-H-5.html#node_cha=
p_4

At the moment you can write fluxus code in drscheme and render the result=
s
to a window using it's native gui toolkit (mred). It isn't remotely stabl=
e
yet using fluxus this way, but it's very early days.

Well, if I'm doing fluxus livecoding - ie visuals to another performer
doing the audio, and if I am trying out a new approach then I try to do
maybe a hour or so a night for a couple of days before the gig. I'll have
a clear idea about the area I'm going to explore (recently, using the
fluxus turtle to procedurally deform a mesh, and apply vertex colouring
etc to the geometry) http://www.flickr.com/photos/yesyesnono/tags/slub/

If I'm performing betablocker, I do a bit more, but this is largely
paranoia making sure the latest versions of all the various bits of
underlying software is going to run ok. The actual betablocker virtual
machine code is much less predicable because it's rewriting itself all th=
e
time, so I need to be more alert to read the code and see what's going on=
.
It's also harder to have a plan of what you're going to do.

I think it's hard to get practice right, because if you do too little
there is not enough "flow" and you can feel restricted in what are able t=
o
try out live. You can do too much in the wrong way (concentrating writing
one type of program) and it becomes formulaic.

I think the approach you and Fredrik took was a good one as it was quite
general and exploratory. I'd like to try it out, but it was a little too
punishing for me :)

dave

For me solo live coding is a bit more a private performance art. I 
have the impression the problem is not practise, but inspiration, and 
I still like those patches best (of the ones I did in the practise in 
august) that explored an idea.

In the seminars I give it is normal practise to be in "double 
discourse" about and with the program, recently we programmed an 
artificial acoustic bathtub that way. The sonification workshop with 
Alberto de Campo was also a real success and it was all "live coding" 
(but there was no "audience", only participants).

The recent concert of powerbooks unplugged I liked a lot because it 
is really collaborative live coding, with all the range from 
individual reasoning to collective reasoning. There is a lot of 
potential, but I find it already very interesting.

Hi Andrew,

Great to see your article. I'd love to hear more about Andrew and your=20
current practice efforts as well- do you have any gigs coming up, or what=20
were your rehearsal procedures and preparations for last year's?

Reading through, not sure I'd agree with 'use of pre-established sound=20
generators' because quite a lot of live coding in SuperCollider and those=20
Max/MSP competitions in Belgium, for instance, involves the dynamic=20
realtime construction of a unit generator graph. Manipulating sound=20
synthesis algorithms is often one relatively low-level thing we explore.=20
(you actually tone down this assertion in the next paragraph anyway when=20
you talk about the continua)

In this context, thought I might just mention that I built a realtime=20
'instruction synthesis' compiler as a UGen which I showed at high speed at=20
dorkbot in London before xmas- analogous to some of Dave's work, it seeks=20
to set up a set of primitive instructions, in this case for breakpoint=20
synthesis, which can be manipulated on the fly, thus directly live coding=20
changes to a low-level synthesis algorithm.

Anyway, moving on, I really like this sentence:

'live coding requires not only new performance skills but also new ways of=20
describing the structures of and processes that create music.'

And this is fun:

'Also underscoring this culture of sharing, is a prioritising of reputation =

above (or prior to) profit'

So anonymous releases for all open source in future to avoid charges of any =

personal gain? ; )

You ref me for the practice of projection, but I should mention that Alex=20
has been the most consistent and primary advocate of this since 2000,=20
though he seems to have had some qualms in recent years ( long the=20
pro-acousmatic lines you also mention).

And great to see those further new coverage reports/blogs... we should=20

These are good points, but its certainly possible to practice improvisation 
intensely without compromising specific performances- jazz musicians 
sometimes lock themselves away for 6 months practising their chops 14 hours 
a day... So the last statement is the chief point. What are the best 
practice tactics? Anyone want to list some favourite practice exercises for 
different aspects, i.e. general technique practice versus explorations 
intended to increase the creative scope?

(as a personal confession I'll happily admit that the ICMC live coding bout 
versus Ge wasn't very good, and I've always been disappointed in myself. I 
think one aspect of that sense of failure for me is that I wasn't able to 
adapt to the audience enough when the battle commenced - I had a plan to do 
a complex from scratch Babylonian square root procedure system which wasn't 
so compatible with the occasion in the end. Rather, a whole host of 
different techniques and solutions should be on hand- and this is what six 
months of intensive practice could seek to develop).

We've all noted in the past I think how some situations, like 'background 
coding' or 'collaborative coding' are much less pressured, and here the 
hard practice can certainly be downplayed in comparison to inspiration and 
collaboration.

But the solo or competitive coding situations still exist and I think I 
naturally turn towards them, not because I'm unsympathetic with the other 
roles, but because I'm genuinely curious about human beings being pushed to 
the limits. Musicians often seek out the states where they're on the edge 
and out of their comfort zone, because those are the best learning 
experiences- and I think we need many more high profile failures to learn 
our real limits, or truly surprise ourselves with what we're capable.

I completely agree with the spirit here of pushing the limits and  
embracing experimentation.

Neither my QWERTY skills nor my brain equip me to do the kind of  
command line livecoding that I admire others for. However as a former  
musician (long time ago sadly) I can say that part of the point of  
practising performance is to disengage the consciousness of  
constructing or interpreting anything at all. Discussing what you  
find there is very difficult.

I'd say though that anything that involves moving the brain and the  
hands at the same time would require at least 4 hours practise per  
day, 5 or six days per week. And you would only start to get  
disengaged after 2 or three years.

This of course might not be desirable. I believe theorists can keep  
their hands entirely still for weeks on end and still excel in their  
chosen field of endeavour.

It's not quite the same thing, but I think there maybe some parallel with
normal coding practice here, the state of complete concentration while
programming, having to be disengaged from the rest of the world, losing
track of the time of day. This must be true of playing instruments too?

So to perform well, you have to be able to enter this state, and produce
results in a timeframe acceptable to an audience.

Unfortunately I don't think many languages are well designed for this. Fo=

example, having to actively think about syntax is not coding - and is a
barrier to disengaging. At the right level it helps you, in that the
syntactic rules channel your thoughts into recognised patterns, once you
are familiar enough with a language for them to become second nature.

This knowledge comes with normal everyday programming, whether you do it
in a performative mode or not. Really livecoding practice is more about
accelerating and restricting yourself to things you know well (depending
on how confident you are).

I think so.

Yes.  

I think the from-scratch livecoding practice advocated so far is quite
traditional, in the musical sense.  Nothing wrong with that, as can be
seen in the results.

It's worth stating that the biggest value of this practise clearly isn't
in getting better at typing.  I think it's more about developing a
musical style.

In that case to me internalising musical style through regular practise
seems the wrong approach, for me at least.  What we should be doing is
reflecting upon our livecoding style, then externalising by adding
functions and operators to our livecoding language of choice.  This is a
really big deal, being able to reflect upon our style and change it is a
unique human skill.

Then it just takes a few hours before a gig to make sure we are familiar
with all parts of our language before a performance.

This isn't the same as having pre-written scripts that we modify.
Actually I think this approach is flawed, starting from pre-written code
just doesn't result in livecoding for me - it results in parameter
tweaking.  Ok as a backing track, or emergency fallback position but
nothing else.

On the other hand 'from scratch livecoding' doesn't fit either because
we're not starting from scratch, we're starting from a language
developed for our particular style of music.

Yes absolutely.  I now think Perl is completely unsuitable for
livecoding.

Yes, and I think externalising that knowledge into a function is a
really good way of getting to know it really well.

I've done some terrible performances lately (not the ones with you Dave,
which have been great fun).  I don't enjoy failures but learn much more
from them than successes...  And the audience never hate my failures
more than me, so I don't mind exposing them to it.

As ever I applaud Julian's moves away from the performer/audience
separation.  I think Martin has a similar point of view and it really
seems an interesting way forward.   We should take this on board for the
Sheffield event and try something different.  For example instead of
having a toplap members jam, we could instead each make a simple musical
language (or hone down an existing one), and each set up a computer
running an interpreter with instructions for how to use it, and see what
happens.  Openlab in London have been doing something very close to this
at their events, calling it "PD wife swap." :)

Dear Nick,

Further to your comment in another thread,

"I'd love to hear more about Andrew and your current practice efforts  
as well- do you have any gigs coming up, or what were your rehearsal  
procedures and preparations for last year's?"

Andrew S and I continue to practice together regularly (as  aa-cell),  
just like a rock band I guess. We work on new techniques and  
developing repertoire (and try not get distracted by ongoing  
improvements to Impromptu).

And, yes a we have a couple of gigs coming up in February in Brisbane  
and anticipate more in March/April in Sydney, and perhaps July in  
Canberra (next ACMC). We are contemplating performances in Europe in  
Sept/Oct so any heads-up about opportunities there gratefully  
received ;)

Between these rehearsal times we individually read a lot of music  
composition texts, bone up on programming practices (patterns), and  
work on library functions to make live performance more fluid.

On the matter of engagement during performance, I think this is as  
true for live coding as for any other performance practice, or indeed  
any creative act, and this is independent of technologies (i.e., the  
physical interface or language design matters but is not a  
significant enabler or inhibiter of engagement - they have more to do  
with expressively than engagement, but that's a separate discussion).  
I have written about creative engagement in these places (at least),  
if you want to check them out.

But do you think there is a difference in that the instrumentalist,  
when playing
with his/her ensamble/group, is extremely concentrated on the music
and not on the tool/instrument he/she is using when making the music?

The performer coding away on the computer has to get into the algorithm
and stop concentrating on the music while typing. It seems like an  
oscillation
between being immersed in the music and the abstract machine.

This happens of course with instrumentalists as well, when for example
they feel that they're playing too low and go to the amplifier to  
raise the volume.
But arguably it's not the fundamental mode of the performance.

I'm curious to hear about how all of you subjectively experience the  
music
whilst coding in a live situation. I myself feel that I loose  
connection with the
music when going into the code too much so I tend not to code too  
much in
live situation although I can't resist sometimes. But I might be bad  
at multitasking
or splitting the consciousness into both following the music and the  
algorithm.

> It's worth stating that the biggest value of this practise clearly  
> isn't

Following the argument above, the biggest characteristic of the  
musical style
of live-coding might be that the formal structure of the music is  
dependent
upon how long it takes the coder to code a new theme/part. So the  
instrument
building/designing becomes part of the aesthetic of the music.

I'm probably bullshitting a lot here, but hey

I think what makes sense is abstraction - i.e. prewritten libraries.
"Livecoding from scratch" really means starting with a blank screen, as
true "from scratch" livecoders have to write drivers etc first. Starting
with a prewritten script on your screen *is* parameter tweaking, and I do
a bit of that still but it's getting less and less.

Developing libraries is a very important skill for a programmer, as you
have to distill you philosophy of how to solve a problem into easily
managable blocks. I think this is really interesting when it comes to
artistic software, as this interface defines the philosophy you have to
fit your work into.

This could also be called "style" I think.

For example, lately I've been livecoding a script to do things directly t=
o
vertex data on a raw geometry mesh. I've gone about as far as I can go
with this approach, so I'm writing a scheme module to deal with higher
level geometric operations in fluxus - extruding, lathing and skinning.
These will be the building blocks for upcoming performances - but I still
get to start with a blank screen.

cheers,

dave

In the year 3000 livecoders won't need to actually _hear_ the music when
livecoding it. That will be for the lowly audience only.

:)

In all seriousness, we need to see if we can get to a situation when we
aren't thinking about code at all.

Yes agreed.  I still do parameter tweaking too.  It's like having a
backing track that you can guide a little.

Yes I think we're talking about the same thing.  Making a library,
extending a language, what's the difference?  It's all abstraction as
you say.

The important thing is allowing plenty of freedom to select and combine
those abstractions in an interesting and responsive way during a
performance.  Making new abstractions during a performance should also
be possible, but I think it will be shown to be rare.

I don't think any improvising musician is 'note-level'.  I subscribe to
Jeff Pressing's model of the role of an improvising musician being in
making changes to what they're playing.  A trained improviser's body
plays notes automatically according to some scheme, the music is in
introducing deviations from that scheme, and thematic changes into new
schemes.

I disagree.  Improvisers encode gestures through practise, we encode
gestures through programming.  Combining those gestures is what we can
do 'on stage'.

Isn't programming all about encapsulation?

I'm sure we'd all agree that there are many different types of practice 
activity, and whilst some (as Dave suggests) could come about through daily 
programming work, others might be particular to certain live coding 
contexts and benefit from practice dedicated to that context. Personal 
style is of course a valuable thing, which you would hope in any 
self-critical and interested codiscian, would be developed in innumerable 
ways over time.

On another tack, the issues of the starting point will always come up, and 
do seem analogous to any standard musical improvisation- there are continua 
of frameworks, plenty of interesting styles, and particular choices might 
mean particular practice procedures- and the well rounded musician/live 
coder will want to be ready for a number of different contexts, 
particularly where collaborative performances with unfamiliar musicians and 
unknown audiences might be taking place.

Practice is not independent of the system you prepare for, and the system 
libraries (even prepared outside of live coding, but just as support to the 
intended live coding context) are iteratively informed by the live coding 
experience.

i don't believe this.  musicians learn to sight-read and perform very  
complex tasks.  just appearing on a stage and be in focus must hinder  
the concentration.  they still can create wonderful and engaged music.
thor - it sounds to me like you have a romantic ideal about 'feeling'  
the music.  like [jazz]musicians closing their eyes and lets the

similar to losing track of time while programming.
i'm certain musicians and live coders are the like in this respect.   
ie the result can't be fully appreciated while being created.

A programming language is a textual language designed for human
expression, so not that far from other human languages such as English.
Can a novelist concentrate on the novel and not the language they are
using?

A good question.  When it's good I just become ears listening and mind
playing with music as text.  There is a lot of "what shall I do next?"
Apart from that I don't know how to describe it.  I always mean to look
up and see what video Dave is making, but I never manage it.  Apart from
that I don't know what else to say, I'll think about it straight after
the next performance.

I think we should aim to be able to enact a thematic change within 3
seconds of deciding to do it, which might be faster than instrumental
musicians.

Not do I- music works on multiple interacting timescales. I just said that 
one suspicion might be that the instrumental musician is more able to 
attend to individual notes, whilst a live coder dips into more statistical 
aggregates of activity without following the note by note progression.

Of course, musicians can't always follow every note anyway- but I'll avoid 
the digression into psychological timescales and the transcription problem.

I'm sorry I didn't comment on Jeff's model before when you brought it up 
some months back. I'm still waiting to be allowed to put my PhD online, and 
I say a few more things about it there, but whilst I respect Jeff's work 
very much (and he was a very learned researcher) this particular ostensibly 
reasonable mathematical model needs a lot more work, and a lot more 
evidence/experimental corroboration, to allow it to be applied in any 
specific situation.

Note sure we are disagreeing, and I might pull back before getting into all 
sorts of different gestures. I'm pretty certain, however, that the physical 
scheduling mechanisms are different - witness the reaction times. And live 
coding in the sense I usually mean it (which may be different to what you 
intend) is much more Wanderley and Orio (2002)'s score level than note 
level.

> Isn't programming all about encapsulation?

Sorry, I used encapsulate as a pun then. I do assume there are cerebral 
methods to hold certain algorithmic gestures, which doesn't mean these 
algorithms can be spilled out at note speed unless you precoded them.

I guess its interesting to imagine a live coding mental million armed 
octopus, holding a maze and mire of algorithms in its repertoire, waiting 
to fire them off in response to the slightest and quickest of provocations. 
But this would really be like an interactive music system, even where human 
guided, rather than live coding in my favoured sense, which involves 
fundamental rewrite engagement with algorithms on-the-fly.

but I'll stop wittering on too much, very interesting seeing everyone's 
comments today!

Yes agreed.  But there is code particular to a performance, and code
particular to a style.  I do not think we should waste our time typing
code particular to a musical style each performance, but instead make
that style part of our language/libraries.

So where we find ourselves repeating ourselves from one practise session
to another, we should give that repetition a name and put it in a
library, or make it an operator or construct or whatever.

Yes, good point.  I do find though that if starting points are too well

Well put -- I think this iteration is an extremely creative one.

I guess not. Writing is very much "about" language. But when you speak
different languages you're not aware of the language you are speaking
at a given time until you reach a situation where you're lacking the  
word
or become unsecure about grammar.

So it seems to me that your analogue is saying that live-coding is  
like writing
a novel but playing an acoustic instrument is like speaking.

I suspect you don't like that interpretation : )

Isn't it the description of the music? I'd say the ontology of music  
is bound
to be as a sound primarily. But ouch, we're into difficult territory  
here.

Yes, I agree. That's the aim.

Would you say this counts only for music performance or also for 
performance art ? What makes the difference between the two 
connotations of "performance" in terms of live coding?

the important point about the ability to refactor code live that we 
addressed in our 2005 ICMC paper seems to be connected to what you 
are saying. The difference between conducting and improvising may be 
that we can cross levels - we can make part of a background gesture 
subject to change and then again merge it with the background. It is 
this background where "immersion" takes place, but it is contrasted 
with the invention and verfremdung that happens when the framing 
changes (in code and in sound). This is something I practise (but not 
only in live coding).

He he. Yes and be intoxicated with drugs and all that....

But I have to object to this Fredrik. I'm not thinking about the  
performance as some
kind of oblivious state where everything disappears into some magical  
moment and
the performer is one with the music. It's nice to think like that,  
it's romantic, I agree,
but it might stink : )

What I'm interested in here is the phenomenological experience of how  
we relate
to the tools we are using. I'm thinking of Heidegger here, who made a  
distinction between
tools being ready-at-hand or present-at-hand. He took the example of  
a carpenter who
used his hammer without being aware of it (ready-at-hand) until the  
head the hammer fell off
and then suddenly the hammer appears as an object in it's own right  
(present-at-hand)...
it changed a phenomenological mode so to say.

What I'm getting at, is that using the computer, a meta-machine, is  
very much an oscillation
between those phenomenological states of ready and present-at-hand as  
the interface and the
things that we do with the computer are so complex and "meta" that it  
will never be as
simple as using a hammer or playing a clarinet.

i see live coding as performance art.  the artist(s) provoke and  
involve the audience, make statements that confuse or muse.  just  
happens that for many of us here there's a dac involved.

Hi, I only occasionally check threads on this list so i may have
missed a lot of discussion, but the thing that really strikes me is
that everyone still appears to be constantly comparing livecoding to
playing acoustic instruments - is this really necessary? the
implication is that livecoders are worried their practice is inferior
in some way.

this is interesting. i agree, but feel as though i shouldnt, because
i'm primarily interested in aesthetics and therefore only concerned
with hearing the results (too much code and not enough mp3s shared in
livecoding land in my opinion...)

Yes, I'd agree with this. For me, livecoding isn't about the skill of  
musical performance so much as it is that doing so makes a statement  
that is integral to a creative agenda. After all, skill is an  
inherent part of any artistic endeavour (and whether the particular  
artist has skill or not is a different matter and is somehow  
irrelevant to this discussion).

Just my 2p...

Gosh.  When I think about my experiences with livecoding in Perl then I
think I am forced to agree.

But when I think about some idealised language for livecoding, with
syntax that doesn't get in the way of free thought, and with
extensibility that allows clear encapsulation of musical style in the
language, then I disagree.

The question then is, is that idealised language possible?  If the
answer is 'maybe', do we have it already, and if not how can we make it?

I don't think that sound is music.  Music is what we imagine in the
first place and perceive in the second place, sound just allows us to
connect the two.  We imagine an algorithm, then write it down so it can
be interpreted, turned into sound and then perceived by the author/s
and/or audience.

Converts a buffer of virtual machine instructions into synthesis. Based on 
breakpoint manipulation with linear interpolation.

bufnum- Number of buffer holding instructions on the server in the form of 
successive COMMAND/PARAM PAIRS

The limited command set:

0 interpolate from last to new breakpoint over PARAM *5000 samples (ie down 
to about 10 Hz, sampling rate dependent)
1 new random breakpoint from PARAM.rand2
2 new breakpoint by perturbing last breakpoint amp by PARAM
3 new breakpoint by interpolating from last breakpoint amp to its inversion
4 new beakpoint by interpolating (t=PARAM) last two breakpoints (zero amp 
breakpoint by instruction (3,1) then (4,0.5))
5 new breakpoint by damping last breakpoint amp (multiply by damping), 
damping= PARAM
6 new breakpoint at amplitude +PARAM

8 do next command if probability PARAM
9 goto instruction PARAM

In most cases, sensible values for PARAM are from 0.0 to 1.0!  But 
instruction 0 will need much larger values in samples.

Hi Ade,

the artistic posturing can be independent of the skill, but I am explicitly 
interested in developing skill sets for live coding, and the best ways to 
practise (but not practice...). I guess you can practise your artistic 
statements while I practise my practical livecodiscianship ; )

So, performance art is one confrontational aspect, but I'm curious about 
taking the notion of live coding seriously as a (probably naive) musician. 
This might also answer Peter's question about comparison to musicianship: 
existing musical abilities provide interesting parallels, particularly 
where you want to play with acoustic musicians! It might turn out that live 
coding is too awkward to comfortably play alongside those uber-physical 
cerebralists, but I'd hope that we can get there (the bar being set in 
Alex's point about seeking perceptual present/short term memory length 
turnarounds).

Again, this is me thinking back to my saxophoning/guitaring past, but  
when you're jamming and you want to fuck with your bandmates' heads  
there's nothing so effective as a sub-second turnaround - 3 seconds

I think it's something to strive for, and it's one of those things where
everyone's going to have a different ideal... This is why I like silly
little languages implemented in silly little languages, it breaks down
the notion that there is one way to do things.

Right got you, we are of course not dealing with sequences of notes
directly but some higher order representations, and we can show this is
a straight trade off - less note-by-note control, more control over
structures of notes.  But again, as Pressing suggests, humans might be
doing this internally anyway.

As you say though, this is untested.  If nothing else though, it does
seem like a good model for livecoding, and whether it matches human
cognition or not, we can still appreciate the results as music.

Yes true, although I'm not clear on whether you mean in terms of

I quote descriptions of those classifications from this paper:

1. Note-level control, or musical instrument=20
   manipulation (performer-instrument interaction)
   i.e., the real-time gestural control of=20
   sound synthesis parameters, which may affect
   basic sound features as pitch, loudness and=20
   timbre.

2. Score-level control, for instance, a conduc-
   tor=E2=80=99s baton used to control features to be ap-
   plied to a previously de=EF=AC=81ned=E2=80=94possibly
   computer generated=E2=80=94sequence.

To give a little more context, the names of the other classifications
they give are

3. Sound processing control, or post-production activities
4. Contexts related to traditional HCI, such as drag and drop, scrubbing
5. Interaction in multimedia installations

... later they are clear that some things won't easily fit their
classification.  I think we agree that livecoding is one of them.
However, livecoding commonly involves "musical instrument manipulation"
on a startlingly fundamental level.  Also by "score level control" they
appear to mean controlling a pre-written score.  While some attempts
(including many of my own) at livecoding amounts to this, it would not
seem to be anyone's aim.

"Pre-coding", if I understand what you mean by that, is not cheating.
It's just reflecting upon your way of working, and removing duplication
of effort.  It's giving that thing you do a name and some parameters, so
that you can do it more quickly, just by typing in that name.  It's
spotting the same pattern of working in other areas of work and
generalising the function so you can use it there, too.

Sure, but I'm not talking about giving a note generating algorithm a
name, and then typing in the name of that algorithm in order to generate
notes of that type.  This I suppose is how I did things before the
changing grammars conference although I didn't have an octopus, just a
bash shell :)

Instead I'm advocating reflecting upon the ways that we make note
generators, and building up a library of functions that allow us to do
so.  If done right, this should allow us to concentrate exactly on these
fundamentals rather than get bogged down in typing in the same old
constructs and patterns.

This by the way the enthused haskell beginner programmer in me
speaking... =20

Anyway, sorry if I appear argumentative today, I'm just thrashing out
ideas.

I've livecoded with people playing conventional instruments a number of
times.  Sometimes I feel inferior, sometimes not, but never superior so
perhaps the balance is against me.

The best collaboration so far was a headphone performance with Ade and I
livecoding with a singer - Lottie Child.  I'd say the three of us had a
comparable expressive range and rate of change.  It was totally
improvised, no practise at all but we really enjoyed it.  I was using
Perl and did a lot of from scratch coding, come to think of it I'm not
sure if I used any pre-prepared scripts, I think probably a couple.

Sadly the recording of it didn't work, although there happened to be a

The code (with revision control) is a recording as much as an mp3 --
just much better compressed! :)  I agree though that hearing the results
is important - an unsonified algorithm can't be music.  

I think livecoding necessitates a lot of reflection and thought about
how you make music, and that this is why there's a lot of discussion.  I
think the ultimate result of the discussion though is more music.

I was interested in the idea of code version control as something  
analogous to a sound recording, and am trying to disentangle it in my  
head. Previously I had been considering it as more like a score -  
even a Cageian instruction set of a score - and I remember discussing  
the mechanics of algorithmic music production with a music publisher,  
mostly about how much of the machine needs to be documented or  
archived before it can be considered a 'musical work' by lawyers  
(cultural guardians that they are).

This probably only illustrates the limits of metaphorical (or my)  
thinking. I don't know if I think an unperformed score is music. I'm  
sure that a performance is music, whether or not there's a score. Not  
that I want to drag this very interesting and open thread down the  
barren path of intentionality, but I would like to keep the  
possibility open that an unsonified algorithm can be music, based on  
some conditions which might even be unspecified.

Well perhaps we can reach agreement by saying we can musicify an
algorithm in our heads just by reading it and imagining its execution
and result, therefore bypassing the sonification part.

Then we're saying an algorithm isn't music until you musicify it, which
seems rather obvious, but forces us to focus on human perception of an
algorithm rather than the algorithm itself.

But this is of course just a conceptual mess where we are using  
different
language games (cf. Wittgenstein) to talk about phenomena that are
related (and which we conceptually put under one hat).

Consider the word "book" for example.

- A stack of printed papers could be called a book.
- I could have an idea in my head and call it a book.
- The laws of physics could be called "the book of nature"
- 3 printed books in one volume could be called "one book"
- Tibetans have strips of paper (ca. 35*8 cm) unbound and they call  
it a book.
- We could imagine a software that generates text and call that a book.

- And we can argue whether any of this is a book or not.

The word etymologically seems to come from the bark of a tree, both the
germanic root ("book") and the latin root ("libri").

Now the etymology of "music" is quite interesting as it comes from the
Greek "mousike techne", meaning the art (techne) of the Muses.

Not that this is important in any sense.

I like your arguments Alex, especially this one: "The code (with  
revision control)
is a recording as much as an mp3 -- just much better compressed! :)  "

but note that you use the word "recording" and not "music" here.
recording of what? ... the music?  so what's the music then?

This is endless : )

heh, you're right of course. one way of looking at it is music as a
virtual concept (in the deleuzean sense). it can be 'actualised' in
any number of different ways - a score is one actualisation, every
performance is a separate actualisation, a set of algorithms is
another actualisation etc etc.

Yes you're right, the term music is rather loose.  Here I was using it
to describe the whole feedback process from musician, through instrument
into sound and back to the musician as percepts via ears.  I find this a
useful way of using the word, but apologise if it's wooly.

We can identify where music passes during musical activity, and also
where it gets frozen as a recording, score or piece of code.

The difference is that the revision control files contain a symbolic
recording of the music whereas the mp3 is a recording of sound pressure
over time.  The former is much more useful.  We say mp3's are 'lossy'
but compared to code, even .wav files lose all sorts of data, leaving us
just with stupid samples of soundwaves.

Also we don't *have* to save the code changes, we can just play with it
in transient memory.  That is, we don't have to take a recording of the
code.  We can play with the music as live code and then close the
editor, the sound stops and the music lingers only in our human
memories.  Code only becomes a recording when we save it to disc for
later recall.

A human activity, I suppose.

Relevant here I think:
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapir%E2%80%93Whorf_hypothesis

Includes this quote:

Human beings do not live in the objective world alone, nor alone in the
world of social activity as ordinarily understood, but are very much at
the mercy of the particular language which has become the medium of
expression for their society. It is quite an illusion to imagine that
one adjusts to reality essentially without the use of language and that
language is merely an incidental means of solving specific problems of
communication or reflection. The fact of the matter is that the 'real
world' is to a large extent unconsciously built upon the language habits
of the group. No two languages are ever sufficiently similar to be
considered as representing the same social reality. The worlds in which
different societies live are distinct worlds, not merely the same world
with different labels attached... We see and hear and otherwise
experience very largely as we do because the language habits of our
community predispose certain choices of interpretation. (Sapir, 1958
[1929], p. 69)

From: alex <alex
Date: Fri, 26 Jan 2007 19:57:41 +0000



Sorry for the late notice, but I thought some livecoders in London would
be interested in the laptop drumming circle.  We're meeting this Sunday,
let me know if you're coming along.

Details follow...


OPENLAB LAPTOP DRUMMING CIRCLE

place: state51, 8-10 rhoda street
time: 2pm, sunday 28th jan
if you arrive late: phone 07976552375 to get in (or we won't hear you)

kind of a practice, although i guess there will be a lot of technical
set up time and testing of timing algorithms and protocols.

* no melodies (grey area - pitched drums are ok, but timbre is the
focus)
* no sequencers, algorithmic rhythms only!
* free software only (closed source o/s accepted)
* no real drums (unless robot controlled)

http://www.pawfal.org/openlab/index.php?page=LaptopDrummingCircle


Directions:

Find your way to where brick lane crosses bethnal green road.  The
number 8 and 388 buses, or the Liverpool street, Old street
or Bethnal Green tube stations should help.  (Note that shoreditch
station is now closed.)

Once there, grab yourself a tasty bagel from one of the local bagel
shops.  When ready, go north up brick lane until you see rhoda street on
your left.

Best viewed in a fixed width font:

    rhoda street

           brick lane
              

state51 is on rhoda street, has 'state51' written on the gate in times
new roman. go up the metal stairs on the left hand side and knock on the
door.  unless you're late, in which case ring 07976552375.

cheers!

Peter Worth said :
> how did this go? any chance the timing protocols etc will be documented?...

it was fun, there were about 6 drummers who turned up, ranging from pd, haskell, fluxus, sc to homebrew 
software. 

there was no timing protocols though, we just agreed on a bpm and each starts/stops their algorithms humanly. 
however, each drumer seems to have "nudge" or "drift" function so that timing can be shifted on the go.

we did however talked about how to structure the druming. ie, each take turns to lead while others follow, or 
through some led light controled by software, or a human conductor. its not decided yet. but its worth 
document this for sure, imho. perhaps on that wiki page?

Date: Fri, 9 Feb 2007 15:45:28 +1000


Hi all,

aa-cell were hoping to record our recent gig.  Unfortunately, for  
various reasons this didn't happen**.

However, we did record one of our rehearsals which I have uploaded to  
the impromptu website.  You can download an mp3 of "Bowerbird" from  
http://impromptu.moso.com.au/gallery.html.  The picture next to the  
download is from the gig.

We have several more gigs coming up over the coming months and will  
endevour to do a video recording of at least one of these.  Our more  
ambitious goal is to screen capture, video capture and audio capture  
a performance and then try to reassemble on DVD.  Not sure when we're  
likely to get around to this though ;)


Cheers,
Andrew.S.


** Have other live programmers experienced audio problems when using  
video projectors (earthing problems/ground loop etc.)  Seems to be an  
ongoing problem for aa-cell - not sure what we're doing wrong.  We  
seem to end up with really noisy signal as soon as we start  
projecting - obviously highly undesirable!!  The problem is  
exacerbated by the fact that we rarely use the same projector twice  
and often have very little setup time or control over the performance  
space.  Any suggestions/thoughts greatly appreciated.

Have you tried unplugging your power supply and performing off  
battery? This usually helps although it's obviously not desirable if,  
like me, your battery is an OAP. The other thing to do is to try to  
ensure the projector is fed off the same power supply/socket as your  
computer, since this means they're both using the same earth loop and  
should have the same phase.

Otherwise, investigate a hum suppressor box, these are often used  
with DI boxes in staged environments with laptops to avoid such  
problems - it won't make it go away completely but it might help a lot.

Hope that helps a bit,


Ade.

hi Andrew,
beautiful track!  thanks for sharing.  you've really got something  
going there and i look forward to hear/see you perform here in europe  
soon.
though compared from hearing you perform live, i did lack one little  
thing... the all so quiet rattle of you two typing away like mad on  
your keyboards.  so please - feature request for the next mp3.

i've been fighting projector hum a fair bit and Ade is right.  try to  
make sure laptop+beamer uses the same power.  although this seems  
counterintuitive and many sound technicians wont let you run a  
projector on their clean sound power supply.
another very efficient way is to remove the earth from the projector  
with a homebuilt earth->noearth cable (some gaffa also works with the  
plugs we have here in .de).  no hum but a brutal if not illegal  
method.  and if something happens you didn't hear that from me ;-)   
see it as a desperate last solution.

Thanks Fredrik.  We're definitely going to try to make it to Europe  
sometime this year (hopefully to ICMC and then bum around europe for  
awhile :-)

Yeah.  We audio capture inside Impromptu so no keyboard sounds (or  
audience for that matter)  We might have to mic up the keyboards and  
route them into Impromptu so the click/clacks get captured as well.   
Or we could use sampled sounds and trigger from the keyboard as  
normal audio events inside Impromptu - sample some huge old monster  
of a typewriter :)

Sounds like we'll have to get a bit smarter about power supplies/ 
sockets.  Adrian's battery suggestion seems a good one - we'll give  
this a try and see how long we can go without power.  AB remembers  
removing the earth from his big bad rock band days - if possible we'd  
like to try to avoid that option :)

Funny, being brought up on a trumpet the whole musicians using  
electrical power thing just sort of skipped me by :)

Thanks for the suggestions (Adrian as well !! )

Cheers,
Andrew.S

     Lovely work!

     By the way, all, I recently started playing with the music, video,
and dance improv group "dud"[1]. The only livecoding per se is with
video so far, but I expect I'll be doing some music livecoding with them
soon.

Subject: Re: [livecode] sapir-whorf hypothesis
Date: Sat, 10 Feb 2007 10:28:47 +0100



This has been buzzing around my head for a fortnight.

Comparative philology is a very arcane area of study. There's so much  
controversy around what came to be called the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis,  
even though S+W never seemed to hypothesise quite so formally.

Pinker has argued quite convincingly for a universal underlying  
linguistic foundation, which cuts right across S+W. I have not read  
as much Pinker as I probably should have. But I foound this rather  
nice Pinkerish statement:

"Because chimps and monkeys show similar expectations about objects,  
languages are probably built on concepts that evolved before humans  
did," Spelke suggests.

http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2004/07.22/21-think.html

And many of these debates seem to revolve around Chomsky, whose  
career has swung so sharply between academia and popmedia I have  
never managed to get a fix on anything he might or might not have  
thought.

Formalism is interesting in its own right, I'd say, whether or not  
you can explain the human mind as a formalist system, and whether  
that system, if it exists, is already there and complete, or whether  
it is built while we acquire uses for it.

But it is an interesting idea to play with. Am I thinking about  
algorithmic processes or are they thinking about me?

hehe, a sampled old typwriter would be fun.  but perhaps leave out  
the 'pling'?  entering amy's domain there.

i just tried with a tiny piezo attached to my keyboard - as a contact  
mic.  went via a mixer directly into my laptop and that sounded  
pretty good already.  it also picked up some harddisk rattle.  i  
livecoded a delay in sc and got this strange longwinded feedback.   
might use this sometime.  though i should get a good sounding  
oldskool pc keyboard first.  my laptop keys sounds a bit thin.

Impromptu 0.98 is now available for download from
http://impromptu.moso.com.au/downloads.html

The primary addition for this release is OpenGL support.  Currently  
only a subset of opengl is implemented but this will expand with  
future releases.  Please let me know if your favorite opengl function  
isn't available.

You can find examples, videos, recordings, tutorials etc. on the

Hi list,

    I'm new to this list and new to live coding.  I'm just curious what you
experts would say is the best place for a newcomer like me to begin live
coding?  I'm reading up on ChucK and I have worked with CSound, Max/MSP, and
PD before.  I'm not a programmer (yet) but I do understand a little about
how to program.  My goal is to do live audio coding.  I'm running a Linux
(Ubuntu) OS and have lots of time to learn.  Should I spend more time
reading up on programming or on practicing/experimenting?  Basically I'm
looking for any pointers or good howtos out there thanks.

I'm no expert, but I say start hacking/coding/playing!  Get comfortable=20=

in the languages and environments - even if you don't start out coding=20=

"live".  In fact, it may be more productive to learn the ins and outs=20
and nuances of the languages first, and develop your own sense of what=20=

it means to live code.

Also, while I'm glad you are looking into ChucK (for wholly biased=20
reasons), I'd additionally recommend checking out the wealth of live=20
coding systems out there, including SuperCollider, Impromptu (.98 just=20=

released a few hours ago), PERL or python based systems, etc:  here is=20=

a list:

     http://www.toplap.org/index.php/ToplapSystems

Most of the environments can take a little getting used to, or possibly=20=

more if you haven't programmed a lot before.  But that's part of the=20
process I reckon, and I think that's why it's good to do at least a=20
little every day or so.  Depending on your world view, there may be no=20=

wrong way to live code, or possibly no right way to live code.  The=20
best thing to do is to fire away.  Do some of everything, write code,=20
read, think about how you might turn your existing Csound, Max, or PD=20
environment into programming-driven meta-instruments, listen, code=20
more, share your code, start a live coding session with your=20
neighbor/friend/significant other...

Fire away.  Yeah?

Best,
Ge!

I'm in a similar position - i've been using pd for the last year or

soon as possible. i can't decide which though... i don't suppose
someone could neatly sum up the advantages/disadvantages of each? i've
done some scheme a while ago, but i think it would take a fair bit of
work to start thinking functionally rather than procedurally, so would
supercollider be a safer bet? i suppose i should just play around with
both and see which i get on best with.

i've answered my own question. i'll be quiet now.

Hi Pete,

You know I was kinda looking for a similar "these are the (dis)advatages of
each language" reply from someone with experience.  I'm interested in things
like full blown Ruby or Python, but I'm worried that they might be too
daunting of a language.  Are languages like ChucK or supercollider that
focus on audio limited in any regard?  I realize that these answers will
depend greatly on people's opinions and preferences but I'd still like to
hear what "the pros" on the list have to say about the subject.

SuperCollider is a very good option to do Live Codiing.  I have worked
the last three years with SuperCollider and myself to given very good
results.  Very low cost of CPU, extensive librerias of UGENs,
excellent results utilizing paterns etc.  I recommend you to read of
the help general "intro-to-object " to give you a complete idea

it is what I can suggest

I would say definitely not.  That focus means they have fewer
limitations in that domain.  In my experience music libraries for
general purpose languages are based around rather restricted ideas about
what music is, and wildly outdated tech such as general midi.

Also I've heard a couple of experienced hackers (whose opinions I
greatly respect) who have independently heaped praise upon the
supercollider language itself.  This surprised me somewhat, it seems it
is a very fine example of an object oriented language.

I'm desperately trying to get a grasp of hsc, the Haskell bindings for
the supercollider synth.  I'm now really tempted to try out impromptu
too, it sounds really good...

The Supercollider language is heavily based on Smalltalk, which is one
of those languages (like LISP) that was so awesome it hurt, but alas
was too far ahead of its time and never hit mainstream (many languages
like python and ruby still don't support all the sweet features)...

The ones I use the most:

C-x h	select all
C-space start mark
A-w     copy between start mark an cursor to kill buffer
C-y     yank (=paste) from kill buffer
C-k     kill (cut) rest of line to kill-buffer

i didn't know it was based on smalltalk.. that's definately a plus. as

Yeah not full livecoding, you'd be coding live but the code wouldn't be
live...  But sometimes the simplest solution is best.

I did find a way of livecoding java classes using reflection and proxy
objects, and was hoping to get it working with processing, but I'm
afraid lost interest.  Am happy to share my experiences+code though.

In case you haven't already tried it, I had good experiences with oscP5
(it Just Worked), and it has some 'broadcasting' stuff (client/server)
although I didn't try that part

Heh, funny :)

BTW rather than maintain a central server why not just have the clients
sending UDP to the network broadcast address?  A web search reveals

I had a good meeting with Jim in Sheffield, will post very soon with the
exciting details...

The most important thing is still the date, we thought early summer
would be good.  So how about doing a pre event/party/gig in London on
Thursday June 7th, followed by June 8-10th in Sheffield.

These dates are the same time as NIME2007 (June 6-10), when many of us 
might be out of the country (depending on their decisions about 
papers/performances).

The week afterwards I have another conference in Leicester, which is 
perhaps not totally incompatible, and the week before (May 28th to June 
3rd) would be fine for me. But hey, just finding a date a majority are 
happy with would be great.

Ok good point lets rule that out.  I don't think we should go earlier
than that so lets look for later dates.

How about either 21st-24th June (same time as glastonbury, might reduce
numbers a little?), 30th June-1st July or 5th-8th July?

From: alex <alex
Date: Mon, 19 Feb 2007 22:30:49 +0000



Hi all,

So I met with Jim at access space in Sheffield.  He's been working hard
and now has some good funding, and I think we can make this a great
event.

We're still to settle on a date...  Please send your preferences to the
list or add to the wiki.
  http://toplap.org/index.php/LOSSLivecode2007

June 28-July 1st is currently looking a favourite...


schedule
--------

A hypothetical sketch of the event could be;

Thursday - gig in London, music + video performances into the night=20

Friday - travel to Sheffield in the morning, settle in then maybe have=20
   some workshop time and a dinner together

Saturday - Symposium, some shortish presentations followed by more=20
   performances

Sunday - walking?  There's some beautiful must-see countryside around
   Sheffield including probably the best climbing in the UK...  And=20
   goodbyes + travel back

What do people think about the London event?  If people are travelling
far then more travelling from London to Sheffield might be a bit too
much. In any case I think the symposium and performances in Sheffield
should be the focus.  Any thoughts on this?


money
-----

There will be a limited travel bursary that people can apply for.  There
will also be commissions to contribute towards developing new ways of
performance/some new software/new track/combination of above. =20

The biggest commission will I think be =C2=A31000 (1485 euros), with othe=
rs
around =C2=A3300 (445 euros).  This part is not fully worked out but
personally I'd like this to not be too much like a competition.


publication
-----------

We also discussed making a print-on-demand publication of short papers
given during the symposium, done in advance so we can have copies during
the event.  It could include a collection of our various previous
writings on livecoding as well as the papers written for the symposium.


Thoughts?

cheers

At least for me, 5th - 8th July could work better than the 21st-24th 
and the 30th June. There is a conference in Cologne that I help 
preparing, which is on 28-30 June.

Thanks Julian.  I think 5th - 8th July isn't good for Nick but what if
we push it back further into July?  13/14/15 July or 20/21/22 July?

I guess we could end up pushing this around all through the summer trying 
to find dates everyone can do ; )

I don't mind if you have to leave me out (or partially involved - 5-8th 
could make 5-6th of perhaps)- but my preference is 20/21/22 July when I'm 
relatively available give or take an exam. 13/14/15 I'll be near Cologne 
myself...

Or 25-28 Sept, I don't mind a clash with ISMIR since I probably won't go, 
and then the Andrews might be able to join in...

Such a proliferation of options. Alex, you might have to make a hard 
decision and just grab one...

Yes, sorry if this is getting tedious for others but we do need to

Ok so 20/21/22 July is OK for Julian, Nick and I, so we could be on to a
winner...  Anyone else?

Hi Peter,

I'll try and do this as objectively as I can:

PhDs in composition are a rare treat if funding is involved; you probably 
know already, but it's a hard one to get funding for, though I believe in 
recent years I've seen composition PhDs with funding advertised at 
DeMontford and at the Sonic Arts Research Centre at Queen's University 
Belfast.

Searching for PhD studentships at jobs.ac.uk with 'music' as the key word 
gave a mention of a few places, like Cardiff:

http://www.jobs.ac.uk/cgi-bin/search.cgi?keywords=music&jobtype=02&referer=student&contract=00

Not sure of your own background, and when you say live\interactive do you 
mean electronic music, and if so, to what degree technology development and 
what degree creative applications? Because the places that might have 
funding or might be good centres for electronic music aren't necessarily 
music departments. And I don't want to discount overseas possibilities too, 
though you may have family commitments or the like.

In some ways, the best advice is to seek out a potential supervisor and/or 
project you want to work with.

best,
Nick

They're a rare treat for sure. My first thought was to try for one in
York at the music research centre, where i did my MA. There are
various bits of funding available and i think i'd stand a reasonable
chance, but then i realised I don't want to spend my entire academic
career in a single institution, hence looking elsewhere for similar
departments to the York MRC (which sit between a music department and
an electronics or computing department).

I saw the Belfast projects as well, they look good actually... and
i'll check out DeMontford - thanks for that.

Yes, i do mean electronic music. I'm from a technical background, but
I'm really now only interested in the creative applications of
technology. Livecoding, interactive compositions, realtime
environmental sound processing etc. Institutions which aren't
necessarily music departments sounds interesting... can you give a
couple of examples?

Thanks for the advice, it's much appreciated.

Hi Peter,

If it's the creative applications that you're
interested in, perhaps art colleges are interesting
alternatives to music departments? Or music colleges,
particularly if you are interested in working with
performers too? The latter often have specific
composer scholarships available.=20

But check out music informatics and other science
related departments  - a lot of interesting stuff
often happens in them!

Although biased (as my current affiliation), The Royal

Imperial and City which can be useful on the technical

Hi All,

Does anyone on the list know of any live programming history relating  
to D.J.Collinge's Moxie computer music environment?  He seemed to be  
totally onto live programming as a performance practice pre 1984! but  
I can't find any specific information describing performances etc..   
I would love to hear from anyone who has any information about  
Moxie!  (My only links are Collinge's 1984 & 1988 ICMC papers which I  
traced back via Dannenberg's Moxc).

It appears that Impromptu has a great grandfather that I never knew  
about :)

Cheers,
Andrew.

p.s. If you haven't read the 1984 ICMC Moxie paper, definitely worth

Dear all,

The new Hybrid Arts category of ArsE Lec below might be a suitable venue 
for a TOPLAP submission? I'm happy to put something together (using Ade's 
existing video for the main DVD)

http://www.aec.at/en/prix/cat_hybrid_art.asp

Would people be happy with this? We have some documentation already, I'd 
throw in copies of related academic papers keeping it up to date and 
suggest how we could put on great exhibition performances and collaborative 
coding sessions as part of their festival?

(it would just be a general entry as TOPLAP, hopefully to get as many of us 
there as possible in the event that they're interested).

best,
Nick

Hi all,

Talking of submissions, this might be of interest to
some or perhaps for TOPLAP as a whole:

http://music.sas.ac.uk/research-projects/practice-as-research-online.html

Basically they are putting together an online
multimedia archive of projects, which include
'interactive computer-supported performance'. A
submission could perhaps document some of the
Sheffield conference events?=20

I'd be happy to work on something if others thought it
would be a good idea.

I'll include samples of recent academic papers, links and glue together

Hi Andrew,

If you were considering visiting London near the beginning of September
do let us know well in advance, I could arrange an event around your
visit.  I wouldn't be able to help organise such a thing later in the
month however.

Also I wonder if you'd be interested in coming to 'burningdork', which
was enormous fun last year:

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1; format=flowed

Content-Disposition: inline

Dear list,

For a while links between and some concepts related to the game Nomic and
livecoding have been echoing through my head and I thought I'd share, hoping
to bounce these echos off some other people.

Let me start by explaining a bit about Nomic;
http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/writing/nomic.htm

Nomic is a game where each move is the sugestion (to the group of players)
of a new rule or rule amendment to be added to the game's rules. It's meant
to be a anology for laws where the writing of new laws is also governed by
law itself (idealy speaking at least...). Nomic gets defined by it's initial
set of rules that govern things like the turn sequence, the initial
conditions for who wins are intentionally boring in order to get the players
to change them. It's a facinating game if you can pressgang friends into
trying it out with you.

It's not dis-similar to programing, like all game design, but Nomic has the
added "advantage" that you can theoretically make self-modifying rules if
you'd like and can get your friends to vote for them.

Back to Livecoding. It struck me that this is also a case of modifying
"code" while it runs. My rough idea here is that Nomic could be adapted to a
sort of colaborative/ competitive sort of turn-based livecoding where
players would alternate adding (or modifying or whatever) a function to the
shared program. This sounds like good fun but here my train of thought got
stuck with regard to practical implementation. It would be nicest if the
program would start with some amount of code that would help govern the
turns and keep track of who would "win". Ideally this code would also be
editable in some way but it would be hard to get a equivalent of Nomic's
voting procedure (and thus avoid new rules like "if your name is "Kassen"
you win"). It would also be good to try to invent some sort of system that
would encourage musical end results. Perhaps a audience could be used as a
"judge" of both.

So.... That's what I've been contemplating and how far I got.

Yours,
Kas.

I'm very happy that you have such a high opinion of me and a bit envious of
the audiences you are getting :-P

I think so much audience participation will either fail to work (due to a
lack of code that will run) or get very messy very soon.

It might work for a very limited context. Interestingly, a while ago I found
a sort of very limited Nomic (well, it's a game where you can modify the
rules at least) in Fluxx;
http://www.wunderland.com/LooneyLabs/Fluxx/Rules3.0.html

Fluxx, while very enjoyable, is also so random that it verges on not
allowing for real strategy. I think strategy in games is analogous to the
way we put a larger musical structure into code so I fear that limiting the
system in that way will lead to a musically less satisfying experience....
But that's very open for experimentation; I could be completely wrong.

Kas.

Subject: [livecode] livecode bibliography


Hi all,

Just making the TOPLAP submission, I created a bibliography of 
historical/academic papers on live coding to add at the end- anyone want to 
suggest any additional?

(I'll be printing out the submission tomorrow since I don't have so much 
time to do it, sorting tonight, but the bibliographic list could be added 
to the TOPLAP wiki as a resource, and I might 'hard host' it at my site as 
well as an immutable source ; ) )

And just thinking- is the TOPLAP mailing list archive ever going to appear? 
There have been many interesting discussions in the past- a few of us 
surely have complete archives (I have almost complete give or take a 
couple) - should we make these available at some point?

best,
N

This is fantastic Nick!

This one from Andrew which I haven't managed to find myself yet:

Collinge, D. J. MOXIE: A Language for Computer Music Performance. In. W.
Buxton (editor), Proceedings of the International Computer Music
Conference 1984

And a related paper I found while looking for the above although I have
not yet got to read it in detail:

Formula: A Programming Language for Expressive Computer Music
David P. Anderson and Ron Kuivila.  Computer 24 12--21 (1991)

Conversational Languages
Kupka and Wilsing.   (1980)

I added details of the last two to bibsonomy, for easy exporting to BibTeX:
  http://www.bibsonomy.org/tag/toplap

I might find time to add the others there too.  If you already have them
as BibTeX that would be easiest as you can just import that.

I have tended towards keeping archives for list members only in the
past.  However I am happy to go with consensus and open it up to
external references if that's what people want.

For now however, some searchable archives are available here, going back
to mid 2004 (although the earliest dates all show 2005-05-28 for some
reason):
  http://lurker.slab.org/list/livecode.en.html

Log in with user 'toplap' and password 'toplap'.

Do keep hold of your archive though Nick - I'm not sure if I have a
complete one.

There is another Moxie paper too:

---------------------> LOSS Livecode Festival <-----------------------

Sheffield, UK -- 20-22 July 2007

In association with Access Space, TOPLAP and lurk

When we improvise music, we are creating music while it is being
performed. "Live Coding" is the creation of software while it is being
executed; the software in turn generating music or video.

Thanks to dynamic programming languages, the live coder is able to
modify and extend their program without restarts, their music and/or
visual growing with the code that describes it. This way of working
allows instant results for every sourcecode edit. Programming becomes
a fast, creative process - expressive enough that a whole audio/visual
performance may be created as software.

Live Coding began during the 1980s, primarily with FORTH and Lisp. In
recent years new live coding environments and languages such as Chuck,
Fluxus, Impromptu and SuperCollider 3 have appeared, with enthusiastic
communities growing around them. Live Coding performances have also
used PureData, Scheme, Perl, Haskell, Ruby, Python...

In early 2004 the "Temporary Organisation for the Promotion of Live
Algorithm Programming" (TOPLAP) was formed to support open dialog
between all live coders. Since its early beginnings in a smoky bar in
Hamburg, TOPLAP has reached 178 members worldwide, gaining coverage in
mass media and collaboratively organising several international
meetings.

In 2005 Access Space initiated the L.O.S.S. project
(http://loss.access-space.org) to support free music creativity and
distribution. It featured a series of commissions leading to a
Creative Commons licensed audio CD and repository website produced
entirely with open source tools.

Continuing their series of LOSS commissions and events, Access Space
have teamed up with TOPLAP and lurk to create a three day
international festival, bringing live coding musicians and video
artists together to explore and showcase new approaches in live
performing and participatory arts. =20


---> CALL FOR PARTICIPATION <-----------------------------------------

Your performance and/or presentation proposal is called for.

For the latest version of this call, please refer to
    http://livecode.access-space.org/

Commissions are available to help realise ambitious projects and
performances. Presenters and performers will gain free entry throughout
the festival, and those without institutional support may apply for a
small bursary.


---> IMPORTANT DATES <---

    * 14th March - Call for participation
    * 14th April - Deadline for proposals
    * 1st May - Notification of acceptance
    * 16th June - Copy deadline for proceedings (to be confirmed)
    * 20th-22nd July - Conference - schedule TBA=20


---> PRESENTATIONS <---

Short (up to 20 minute) presentations during a day long symposium. The
remit is broad, but possible subjects may include

    * A demo of a novel live coding language/environment
    * Historical context of live coding
    * Live coding without computers
    * Critique of live coding practice
    * Live patching
    * Reflections on live coding experiences
    * Adapting general purpose languages to live coding
    * Analysis of live coding performances
    * Live algorithms that live code
    * Life coding
    * Portable live coding devices
    * Reflective/self-modifying code
    * Live visualisation of sourcecode
    * Collaborative networked live coding
    * ...=20

Proposals do not have to be long - however much or little you need to
explain your ideas is fine.

If you are unsure if you can make it, submit your idea anyway - we may
be able to accommodate a small number of remotely streamed
presentations for those unable to attend in person.

There will also be time for a brief (around three hours) introductory
workshop. Please indicate if you would like to be involved.


---> PERFORMANCES <---

There will be at least two evenings of performances, ranging from 10
to 40 minutes. Please outline what you would like to perform,
including technical requirements. We plan to have at least three data
projectors, many pairs of small speakers for participatory
improvisations, enough headphone amps for 100 pairs of headphones, and
a big stereo sound-system for 'traditional' performances. Please state
your preference, and feel free to be creative (see commissions below).

We are also thinking about a pre-event in London, UK some days before
the festival, let us know if you would like to take part.


---> PROCEEDINGS <---

If your proposal is accepted will be encouraged to submit short texts
and images for publication in the proceedings. All speakers and
performers will receive a free copy at the beginning of the
conference.


---> COMMISSIONS <---

If you would like time or resources to develop a new way of
performing, some new language or software feature, or something else
interesting then please include a short estimated budget in your
brief, which may include an artist fee. Note that due to funding
constraints the project should have a strong audio component. The
maximum commission will be of =C2=A31000 (about 1470 euro).


---> BURSARY <---

A small bursary is available to contribute towards travel and
accommodation. Please include an estimated budget for your attendance
and we will apportion this money based on need. Money is however very
short, if you are a member of an academic institution we are keen to
help you apply for local funding.


---> PROPOSAL SUBMISSION <---

Preferably in plaintext, but all common formats are accepted.=20
Supporting material including web links to previous work, audio=20
and video files are welcome but not mandatory.

Proposals should arrive before midnight, 14th April 2007.

Proposals are accepted by email (preferred):

Yes, although this is really down to the submissions we get for
performances and presentations.  I think there is no point rejecting any
submission within the remit (or outside of it in an interesting way), if
there are a lot of submissions then we can just give everyone 5 minute
presentation slots (controlled by robotic scheduler).  So everyone
please submit interesting ideas and also get the person sitting next to
you to do the same.

There is also the commission side (has to be so due to funding
constraints) which is more limited and makes it a bit more like a
competition.  Maybe there are ways of working against this idea from
within...  One idea could be a commission for a performance by 100
people who get =C2=A310 each for example. :)

perhaps one for both competitive and collaborative coding? The initial=20

A text driven multi-user audio stream, it needs flash 8 or later.
Please play with it!  All feedback very much appreciated, I'm launching
it properly on the 1st April.

I'm still working out how to make my own articulatory speech synth

concatenative synthesis.

I was excited to find out about "Canntaireachd" last night, which is to

It's a bit easier in stereo (the parts are panned), and it's more fun if
there are a couple of others using it at the same time.  I think I'll
make the other parts fade out when they're not in use, it gets really
repetitive otherwise...

"Because the paper has inlined movies, it is best read in a later
version of AcroRead with QuickTime installed."

Abstract:

A dynamic language improves programmer productivity through flexible
typing, a focus on high-level programming, and by streamlining the
edit-compile-debug cycle. Live languages go beyond dynamic languages
with more programmer-centric features. A live language supports live
programming that provides programmers with responsive and continuous
feedback about how their edits affect program execution. A live language
is also based on declarative programming constructs such as rules or
data-flow connections so that programmers can write less code. A live
language should also provide programmers with responsive semantic
feedback to enable time-saving services such as code completion. This
paper describes the design a textual live language known as SuperGlue.
SuperGlue is based on reactive values known as signals that are
supported with declarative data-flow connections and dynamic
inheritance. Through signals and dynamic inheritance, SuperGlue supports
live programming, declarative programming, and responsive semantic
feedback. We demonstrate live programming in SuperGlue with a working
prototype.

I've read this now - a really interesting paper with many lucid points.
It sees live programming languages as separate from dynamic programming
languages.  In these terms something like PD is live, and something like
Lisp or Smalltalk (and their descendants) are not.

"Hot swapping in a dynamic language replaces code so that
its re-execution occurs according to the new version of the
code as opposed to the old version. ... By being based on a simple
data-=EF=AC=82ow model, live programming in SuperGlue goes much more fart=
her
than this: code edits immediately change the program=E2=80=99s data-=EF=AC=
=82ow graph
and the observable execution state of the program."

It also has many relevant references...

     Yeah, too bad he got that wrong, at least as far as Smalltalk is
concerned. Typically, the entire environment, including the code
editors, are implemented in Smalltalk; the system is reflective at every
stage of development. Changing the behavior of the system by changing
the implementation of a method is something that happens routinely
(independently of when that method is run). Whether the development
style is "declarative" or "imperative" is orthogonal.

     He also seems to be under the impression that dynamic systems can't
do type inferencing without manual annotation. This is weird; the whole
point of type inferencing is avoiding such labor. Dynamic systems are
perfectly capable of providing useful "semantic feedback". It makes me
wonder how much attention he actually paid to the Self material he mentio=
ns.

     That just sounds like hot air to me. You can "change the program's
data-flow graph and the observable execution state" with mere code
replacement.

     The system he presents is interesting, but I think he has failed to
understand what came before. And his system looks suspiciously like
something of the long-swaths-of-source-code-in-static-files variety,
which isn't encouraging to me as a performer.

I really love the al-Jazari project.

May I draw the attention of kind livecoders
to a text I have released recently about
India, myth and computation? It's
called The Remix Republik and
I'll be glad to hear anyone's views about
it.

http://algomantra.blogspot.com/2007/03/remix-republik.html

It's about 6000 words over 23 pages of PDF.
The summary is:

India is predicted by many as a rising star in the global village nightsky,
but only one book describes the new zodiac. In the dark theatre of DJ
Fadereu's mind, Google Earth and binary computation copulate with Hindu
avatars and Vedic timekeeping, Neitzche necks with nadabrahma, and
Baudrillard blows apart Bollywood.This cybernetic ride flickers uneasily
through the vast landscape of Indian and Western techno-philosophy.

Meanwhile, the murder of reality is imminent. The media are converting each
street into a studio, masses into extras, and life itself into the new
movie. The dynamics of these phenomenon are mediated by a new logic of
speed, and a new movement determines the games of territorial power. The
present, the past and the future have become exceedingly intertwined in the
instantaneous (and yet ancient) society we live in - we are the remixed
republic. The state of siege now remains poised at the most dramatic point
in our history since the Partition of 1947.

The world's oldest civilization, the author hopes, will rise to the
challenge with befitting ingenuity....

I think the term "document-centered" also is interesting in itself - 
regarding this type of visual double representation: with sound, this

On the other hand, it is interesting to see what is left from

it is worth installing the font ...

just a "random" pick:

"Scripting" is a term that has gained currency in recent years. 
Educational software with some programmability is described as having 
"scripting capability." In part, a meaningful distinction is being 
made: a scripting language promises greater simplicity in return for 
reduced expressive power. But there is a rhetorical agenda as well: 
to reassure the listener that no dangerously substantial ideas lurk 
within. The idea is afoot that students will have no need for the 
specialized skills of programming, because they can just "script." 
This is thin gruel for growing minds.
With no sense of a growing competence and power to which students' tool-related
programming experiences, large and small, might synergistically contribute, the
scriptable tool scenario promises a balkanized educational technology, where
students' ability to "go beyond the representation given" does not get off the
ground. The much preferable alternative, argued in detail by diSessa 
(2000), would include educational tools in, or interface them to, a 
unifying "computational medium." Every episode of scripting would 
then also be an investment in what diSessa rightly calls a new 
computational literacy, and I am here calling programming.

To some extent this is happening - at least in the field of graphics. A
few years ago graphics applications were hastily rolling their own
extension languages, leading to the situation where you needed to learn a
dozen badly implemented and domain specific languages. Slowly people foun=
d
ways to sneak better designed languages in to unify things - and now a lo=
t
of applications are now converging on these languages officially (or at
least using standardised languages).

There seems to be a learning process involved that designing your own
extension language for widespread adoption is a bad idea in the longterm.

The name "scripting language" is indeed a simply a marketing term, but
often they are much harder than "real" programming languages for general
tasks - I've come across many artists who have been forced to learn dodgy
languages and find it liberating when moving to a more general purpose
"real" language.

I really think this sort of thing is an interesting area of research for
livecoding (and programming in general really). For some comparison,
drscheme allows images as values in source and repl:

p_4
It would be exciting to extend it to 3D geometry and maybe sound as well.

in a way, for sound it exists: this is what a node proxy is in jitlib.

but to "really" have a nonsymbolic equivalent, you'd have to project 
the code on a surface that allows to instantiate small microphones on 
the fly.

I've been trying to digest this paper more thoroughly, it's difficult
without using the language itself and not having clear grasp of all the
terms or the other languages mentioned.  But I think there is something
in the "w fill:red" to "w fill: blue" will not immediately re-color blue
all widgets that have been bound to w."

Imperative programs tend to have a lot of initialisation, and I have
found it difficult to know what to do about that when live programming.
Also, what do you do about sub routines that don't return -- how can
they be replaced?  Worrying about this kind of thing puts a lot of load
on the live programmer, who has to construct their program in a certain
way.

Having a chain of functions connected together, and some way of
replacing one function with a new version, with a continuous stream of
data flowing through the functions with lazy execution seems a nice
solution, and AFAICT is how diagrammatic programming languages like PD
works.  I think this is what this paper is proposing for textual
languages.  I suspect an elegant way of doing this in a pure functional
language is possible with a clever monad.

In SuperCollider, both patterns and UGens are purely functional 
higher order constructions. The whole purpose of JITLib is to allow 
to impose changes on those structures that map in a meaningful way to 
their extension (calculation process or sound, dependent on the 
perspective). Depending on the underlying model, this mapping may 
vary, but the assumption of "immediacy" is not valid when the model 
of time is an abstract / structural one. Pattern proxies generate 
coroutines that can be modified even if they do not return. Node 
proxies abstract from buses and allow to refactor synthesis graphs on 
the fly, so that parts of them can be exchanged. All proxies abstract 
from evaluation order as far as possible, and provide meaningful 
"empty" values. For me, the problem you describe has been the source 
of the idea of live coding in a way.

Ok, I've now reread the Algorithms today paper[1] and see that you have
been here before with Alberto and Renate.  

I guess I didn't see the significance of this the first read, as
feedback.pl has a simple approach to live coding and time.  There is one
method that is called once every beat.  The method does something
depending on the number of beats since start up.  Different instances of
feedback.pl sync together by delaying start up time under instruction of
a central time keeping process.  Code replacements to the method (and
those its calls) are enacted by doing reinterpretation between beats.  

This seems a reasonable approach to me, the code decides what to do by
looking at a clock.  Smooth transitions (or otherwise) may then be
handled by the livecoder, just by making lots of small changes towards a
goal rather than big ones.

I built in a way for messages to be passed between feedback.pl
processes, but never used them since.  It at first seemed obvious to
assume that symbolic interactions between musical elements must happen
in the code, in order for interesting music to be made.  It seems though
that these interactions happen in human perception, and there is no need
to make them explicit in the code.  (Well, there is no need, but of
course it may still be desirable for emergent effects and so on that can
result from interacting processes.)

In pure functional programming though, it seems to make less sense to
have functions that just take a timestamp as input, and not take
advantage of for example lazy evaluation.  I think your answer with
jitlib is to have a pure functions that are modified by an imperative
process.  

I think monadic programming could provide a different answer, but I'm
struggling here...  I think it would involve having a pure functional
program that would take edits as input and audio samples as output.  The
edits would describe removal, insertion and replacement of pure
functions within a synthesis graph.  Somehow idempotence would be
preserved.  

The connections between the functions within the synthesis graph is
where the monadic stuff would lie.  These connections would handle
modification of the graph (including creating new connections when
inserting a function), as well as holding state for that connection.
That state would include enough historical context for a function,
whether newly modified or not, to be able to decide what to do next.

Maybe some real haskell programmers can clear up my thinking here...

yes, I think this is one good live coding paradigm - which we should 
give a name. Would it be reasonable to call it discrete time-mapping? 
(a variant may be called time-warping if appropriate)

this is an interesting point. And an experience that may contribute

in a way, yes. What you have in sc is stateless graphs that create 
stateful streams. Proxies implement a semantics of what a change in 
the stateless graph means for the streams. This change can be a 
change by a code modification or by a program that creates the new 
state. Such a program can be composed of proxies, too, of course.

Good question, rewrite rules maybe?  I guess any diff system will make
mistakes though.  I suppose a really good code diff system would be
built into the editor, watching the edits, but even then a programmer
might do clever tricks to save typing.  

Perhaps the live coding languages of the future will be designed to be
easy to diff, so edits can be more easily reasoned about.

I'm just reading about Q, which has similar syntax to haskell but with
dynamic typing and some interesting features.  It has some good music
stuff too, interfacing with pd, supercollider and faust.

maybe yes? e.g. if you apply nonlinear functions to time, so that the 
relation between progression and sound events become too complicated 
to follow, or keep on the verge of comprehensability. This may 
include fuzzy timing, too.

would you deduce rewrite rules from the code changes? I often use 
rewrite rules for composition, but I've never used it for analysis of 
code changes. Maybe in a little language subset it would work.

for me it can be pretty simple. I just want to avoid keeping multiple 
copies of the full code, and just have the changes.

I think if one has solved the reference problem, the diff should not 
be the big structural problem - it is just a mirror of the underlying 
denotational structure.

Aha right, why not use an existing revision control system like svn?

Well I haven't used it, but that you can call functions with unbound
variables is pretty weird, for example where square X = X*X

==> square (A+B)
(A+B)*(A+B)

where A and B haven't been assigned yet...  The interpreter keeps
applying rewrite rules until it can't any more, and then stops.  I'm not
sure what happens then...

maybe a lightweight version of one. But it would have to be pretty 
speed optimised, so I'm not sure if it is overkill.

do you know what it does with recursion? When you write square(A+X) 
what does it do?

Feedback.pl uses RCS which is simple enough.

> do you know what it does with recursion? 

It handles it very well as far as I can tell, perhaps even better than
Haskell.  It is not pure functional because you can have functions with
side effects, but it is still a language based on functions so recursion
is central.  I can't really talk more about a language I have not yet
used though :)

A and X are just variable names, so the same.

Thanks for these movies Dave, the more the better!  I really enjoyed  
rotblox as well.  tcut was also pretty cool.

It's really neat to be able to see what everyone is up to.  I really  
like the idea of people posting links to screencasts.  Obviously we'd  
all like to present "live" but screencasts seem  a reasonable  
alternative for distribution amongst our small, scattered community.

I'd be interested to hear what others think about screencasts of live  
coding performances - or recordings of other kinds.  Is this valid  
and useful or does it detract from the temporal nature of the  
practice.  I'll start the discussion by stating that I'm really  
unsure myself, which I guess is pretty unsurprising given that I'm  
asking the question.  The one thing I'm certainly not suggesting is  
that these recordings be performed in any sense (i.e. I'm definitely  
not advocating recordings being played in concerts).

I love them. I tend to watch most things posted. I have to say though; I
mainly watch them for pure entertainment. It's hard to get something larger
out of most videos because the text is nearly always unreadable.

Dave's Betablocker and al-jazari are positive exceptions in that regard in
that the programing instructions are visually larger and more clear so those
are the ones that I liked best as videos about livecoding so far.

I'd like to see attempts to get around that. It's already hard enough to
read off projected schreens if the font isn't very large but video
compression kills all hope of that. Maybe use could be made of split-schreen
(with one being a close-up or direct feed, the other featuring the
performer) or perhaps even some tactfull use of sub-title files?

The more the video shows of the actual coding the more it should become
clear wether we are dealing with a improvised snapshot of one moment in a
composer/coder's development or a carefully prepared performance that was
practiced many times in that exact form. Ideally I think a video should/
will be self-documenting in those aspects.

Yours,
Kas.

It seems to me, from doing performances with various things (including
al-jazari) that the clearer the code (in whatever form) the better the
audience reaction. 

Also, maybe, livecoding with a visually over complex language is not too
far away from not livecoding at all - i.e. it's just hiding behind
something else, and somehow saying something worse - "you're not clever
enough to understand this, but I am!".

I worry a bit that that is how livecoding is percieved sometimes.

cheers,

dave

I think that's true. I think I wrote a brief note some time back about
obfuscated code. Would obfuscated live-coding be Toplap compliant? To me the
comunicative side to livecoding is a very important aspect and obfuscation
harms that.

That's certainly a risk but it's a thin line. I'd also say that expressing
original and new musical ideas can be a important part and those will need
some time to settle in anyway, likely more time if they are linked to the
specifics of some language. I know that for me coding in ChucK influenced
some of my ideas about music so now there are some ideas that can be
expressed quite naturally there but that might be hard to understand if
confronted with that syntax for the first time. Still; I don't think coding
is that interesting if you don't make something new so that may result in
hard to understand code. Good video could help there. Clearly the video
isn't the preformance but it might help in the communicative process by
giving more time to digest the performance.

Maybe presentation is most important there. You can come across as elitist
with a 808 just as easily so perhaps coming across as if you are trying to
explain and stimulate rather then demonstrate would be enough.

I think your own al-jazari is doing great there. It's very striking visually
and it has that "can I try next after you are game over?" feel that good
games have. My girlfriend (who is just starting out in Java amd likes
experimental music and games) thought the ones where you generated shapes
and sounds were nice for a brief look but the coding context wasn't
imediately clear to her (I blame the resolution). On the other hand
al-jazari was imediately captivating and that one did make her drop what she
was doing. Admittedly a small data-set but it was a very strong responce.

To me beta-blocker comes across like those you-tube vids of expert players
in shooting games ("ikaruga" is a good example). It's beyond my level but it

Thanks!

can you paste the URLs for the originals which aren't in FLV format?

or, if they're original to you but you can't afford the the bandwidth  
to host them, would you please also upload them to Revver and/or the  
Internet Archive (archive.org)?

I appreciate that YouTube provides "easy access", but IMHO flash- 
based players suck to interact with.  (It all goes back to that paper  
circa 2002 saying that Flash/Shockwave is the most deployed web  
browser plugin, and it also happens to encapsulate video, so if you  
were trying to avoid the QuickTime Sorenson vs. Real Media vs.  
Windows Media format war, it was the way to go.)  However, now that  
Quicktime supports MPEG-4 by default, and MPEG-4 is a mostly open  
standard (without getting into the Xiph / patents tangent), I'm not  
sure why FLV still gains momentum as a defacto format.  (Especially  
since VideoLAN so far can't seek within FLV, AFAIK.)

thanks again,

Yes agreed.  As a livecoder it's difficult to win.  Rather than annoy
non-programmers by presenting them with sourcecode that they don't
understand, slub has tended towards making the code deliberately
difficult to read - for example by projecting screens on top of one
another.  But then the same people are probably annoyed by feeling that
they are missing something in a different way...

A third option is not projecting at all.  This doesn't work if you're on
a stage (looks too boring and secretive), but works very well if you're
hidden away.  I have fond memories of Ade and I playing from the back of
a room in Amsterdam, with a room full of people, many dancing, most of
them ignoring us.  It felt a lot easier to gauge their reaction, a
better feedback loop really -- them just hearing and dancing, us
watching and playing.

That's great to hear - I'm much happier with betablocker/al-jazari than
the approach I used in noisepattern - partly that's due to the fact that
it involved manipulating lsystems, which although allow you to describe
very complex patterns, still feel static compared to the dynamic nature
of the much simpler processes involved in the other programs.

Interesting - I think this is actually the best message to send from my
point of view,, ideally i'd like to use live coding to undermine the
idea that programming is hard - that notion is mainly maintained by
programmers in order to justify their existence :)

yes - there are some here:

nice - reminds me of a train sim I had on my amiga - surprisingly
addictive, and it didn't even have sound :) The conditionals and
branches in al-jazari allow it to be very generative in a similar way to
trane, but I haven't quite figured out how to use them yet.

cheers,

I think people quite simply like to see what you are doing. The last gig
I did I spent the whole time looking at the projection with gamepad and
my laptop shut. However overprojection is quite attractive in it's own
way (like the big toplap jam in Aarhus, with 3 or 4 different
mousepointers and cursors on the same screen). Maybe I'm being too
literal, and need to keep my mind open to being more obscure...

I think I'd feel quite uncomfortable doing that, but probably because I
I tend to think of my music as a bit secondary to the visual. I did do a
livecoding gig where I couldn't get the projector to work where people
had to look over my shoulder that was quite fun though.

At aa-cell gigs AS and I have found similar variation in response,  
although on the whole most people like to see the code, and be able  
to read it. We increasingly try to help folk to understand by using  
very obvious (or leading) function and variable names which helps in  
the general sense of anticipation from the audience. There are the  
few who think it's just showing off... you can't please everyone.

Further to this - what I think is very strange is that by and large  
those most likely to start waxing lyrical about intellectual  
masturbation are other programmers - very interesting!

I'm with Dave on the whole programming is easy thing - well at least  
it's no harder than anything else.  Is programming really any more or  
less difficult than writing, singing, surfing, playing the piano  
etc..  There seems to be a general rule of thumb that to be good at  
anything takes about ten years.  So is it harder to learn to play a  
violin or a trumpet,  a piano or a saxophone, to learn a natural  
written language or a formal written language?  My experience is that  
achieving a level of proficiency in any of these is equally as  
challenging.

The main point of the projection for me is to demonstrate to the  
audience that the music is being composed/performed and not played  
back off CD.  Maybe once people are used to this medium and trust the  
performers we might be able to do away with the projection - although  
I suspect that given a choice audiences would choose to keep the  
projection.

A few days to go for the deadline, here is a clarification I just mailed
to someone, perhaps the call is not completely clear so...

The call was for several related things at once:

1/ call for presentation abstracts
2/ call for paper abstracts for proceedings
3/ call for performance abstracts
4/ call for commission applications

My hope is that everyone who does 1/ will also do a related 2/, but it
is not mandatory, for example someone might want to demo their software
without writing about it.  3/ is also encouraged!  4/ is related to 3/,
if you have an idea for a performance but some money would help to
realise it, please apply for a commission.

A couple of paragraphs abstract is fine, if you can get your idea across
in that.

Not many applications for the commissions as yet.  There's a couple for
=C2=A31000 and a few more for a few hundred, ringfenced by the funding
organisations...

Best wishes,

alex

interesting, I hadn't heard of this. The connection is appropriate to

coding of text, and, of course live coding of code.

True. Because of that (and this is a major difference for our purposes)
Livecoding tells the computer what to do while Nomic tells the players what
to do so livecoding isn't quite as self-referential as Nomic. That's a major
issue for me since I'd like the rules of this little (yet to be devised
game) to be administrated at least partially by the computer. Ideally they
should be mutable as well. The problem there (amongst toher things) is that
one of the ways of winning Nomic is pointing out that is has "crashed" which
is a hard way to win (at least in my brief experience with it) while
intentionally getting a livecoding system stuck is quite easy. I'd like the
rules to discourage intentional crashes, at least early on in the game. "I
didn't know you could do that" is more fun then "I wish you hadn't done
that".

Maybe I should read this Glass Bead Game book, it seems like the talk about
that was quite paralel to this idea.

in a way, it is just as self-referential, but the reference is 
polymorphic. i.e. writer - text - sound - writer
or
text - sound - writer - text
or
writerA - text - writerB - sound - writerB - text - writerA

maybe others?

In jitlib there is a special environment (LazyEnvir with Maybe 
proxies) that can be networked and catches recursions. It does not 
look for solutions, but using list comprehensions this might be 
possible, too.

I've just uploaded an mp3 of last nights aa-cell performance.  The  
recording was taken straight from the desk so no typing noises (sorry  
Fredrik ;)  However, there was a video camera at the performance,  
which I assume had an inbuilt mic, so hopefully I can get my hands on  
a quicktime movie.

Subject: [livecode] live coding of an event 
From: m <m
Date: Mon, 07 May 2007 14:48:36 +0100



We're currently planning a 12 hour lif/ve coding event in November and
would appreciate any thoughts/ideas or suggested
participants/proposals towards a (code) working group which will
interface with the event; live coding of the event itself.

Of course, one approach could be algorithm-driven organisation, scheduling
and intervention, but we're also interested in more speculative ideas:
the relation to fiction, invention of an event programming language
(some crossover with the actor model), scripting, event participants
as compilers or interpreters, the construction of event macros, and,
finally, execution. Any thoughts welcomed on or off list.

best wishes

I hadn't thought of this - it's an interesting possibility which could
be added to the event coding toolbase. I've also been playing a bit
with goby.el

http://www.mew.org/~kazu/proj/goby/

within GNU Emacs - evaluating Emacs Lisp within a presentation
format. One further idea is to try and specify what a language could
look like specifically for the coding of an event.

This looks great Alex!, I'm really looking forward to this, as I know  
are others.

Something I am looking less forward to, however, is as outlined below.

Although Nick Collins' contribution to the conference is more than  
welcome, I am never-the-less shocked that he is being allowed to  
present with someone with as scandalous an academic -and personal!-  
reputation as Click "Fast-One" Nilson Close friends of mine in the  
Shropshire market town of Bishop's Castle tell me that he is  
infamous, nay, notorious around those parts, and can barely mention  
his name without cursing and shaking with barely-contained legitimate  
fury! Confronted in person, for example, it will difficult for this  
witness not to demand Click confess the despicable truth of how his  
colleage Benne "became ill", as he glosses it on his frankly shoddy  
homepage. And to think he has the cheek to then present on "Human  
Action", as though his own personal actions have not blighted the  
reputation of certain members of Bishop's Castle community!! I won't  
say more here, but trust there will be an opportunity - if he is not  
banned altogether - for taking this scoundrel to account on this and  
many other matters - both musical - and not.

Subject: [livecode] fluxus 0.12
From: "Dave Griffiths" <dave


"act of a flowing; a continuous moving on or passing by, as of a flowing
stream; a continuous succession of changes"

A graphical live coding environment for Scheme.
http://www.pawfal.org/fluxus/

This release is the result of a partial rewrite of fluxus to allow it to
be extended and used more flexibly in the future. Part of this work was
to integrate it with PLT Scheme (www.plt-scheme.org) which means we can
now start to use it's impressive Scheme editor (DrScheme) for writing,
live coding and debugging fluxus scripts. Screenshot:
http://www.pawfal.org/fluxus/images/mredflux2.jpg

http://www.pawfal.org/fluxus/files/fluxus-0.12rc3.tar.gz

Fluxus requires a recent build of PLT, newer than the officially
released 360 version - I've uploaded the build I'm using here:

http://www.pawfal.org/fluxus/files/plt-369.10-src-unix.tgz
http://www.pawfal.org/fluxus/files/plt-369.10-src-mac.dmg

Online documentation:
http://www.pawfal.org/fluxus/docs/0.12/

Changes:

* now uses plt scheme
* fluxus scripts can be written and viewed from the drscheme IDE
* lots of new documentation
* split fluxus up into modular parts - a livecoding application called
  the scratchpad and a collection of plt extensions for graphics, audio
  and osc.
* a new autogenerated documentation system and online help command
* new low-level renderer control, with support for multiple renderers,
  scenegraphs and physics worlds
* ported lots of application code into scheme modules
* removed the (edit) and (save-name) commands and added a minimal script
  file browser interface to the scratchpad
* added (hint-depth-sort) for correctly ordering and rendering
  transparent objects

Happy hacking,

dave

Subject: Re: [livecode] flyer essay - your input needed!


hacked it to try and make a cleaner edit, enclosed draft below and on page. 
I kept the bits I took out on the wiki for immediate editing, and someone 
might feel strongly and want to put certain bits back in again...


Live coding began when people realised it is actually possible to change 
their minds whilst thinking, and to rewrite a program whilst it runs. 
Humans make dynamic cogs within the threads of rule systems which rewrite 
themselves. By taking control of the technology that mediates between us 
and the creative act, making the technology _part_ of the creative act 
itself, we embrace the inherent creativity of computer programming.

Live coding renders practicable what many forms of sonic/visual exploration 
strive to materialize; the concurrency of creative processes, expression 
and the dynamics of correlative engagement. In many ways, this practice has 
lead to exceedingly different and exciting artifacts ranging from highly 
conceptual music to explorations in its potential as an interface to club 
culture.

In short, livecoding is where musicians, artists and programmers of all 
talents can express themselves artistically through immediate computer 
programming.

I probably should introduce myself before making edits to your wiki.

It got merged into this:

"This new wave of artistic programmers however are once more demanding
more conversational programming interfaces, where someone can not only
change their mind while thinking, but also change the instructions of
their computer program while it runs."

Please do change it, if you don't like it.

I find it very difficult to explain live coding to someone who does not
know what coding is.  It's easy to find yourself describing it in terms
of what it isn't, which is useless if your audience doesn't know what a
compiler is.

I made text the starting point, because everyone knows what that is

Is this a criticism of the current version or more a warning?  I removed
an instance of 'artistic' but couldn't see anything contentious in use
of the phrase 'creative process' in the current version.  "Creativity"
and "art" are overused words, but I think "creative process" is
qualified enough to make it useful again.

For me, a creative process is what humans follow to find something new
(to them) but still valued, within constraints or pushing against
constraints.  A creative process can benefit from fast feedback, so the
creator can act and react without having to wait around.  So I think
it's useful to say that live coding aides the creative process.

I think text and graphs are isomorphic - i.e. you can as easily compile
a binary straight from a tree of nodes, as from a text file. 

I'm a bit lacking in compiler design knowledge, but in most cases I
think a compiler makes a graph from the text, rather than the other way
round.

As text is by far the most conventional form of programming, this is
probably sensible - I just don't think livecoding has to be all about
text.

Sorry for sticking the oar in - something to discuss in Sheffield :)

So what do you suggest instead?  Would you be happier if we replaced
'text' with 'language'?

I definately prefer this version. It is missing the element of showing th=

livecoding, I tried shoehorning it in:

Hi Alex,

yes, it is about the current version of the text. A copuple of other 
thingsm too. Sorry to be so picky, but just take it as my point of 
view. I didn't want to change it all without explanation.


Going through it:


>As a culture we do not doubt the expressive power of language, and 
>indeed computer programmers have long romanticised the textual (and 
>visual) languages in which they work. With the development of new 
>programming environments for making music and visuals, artists are 
>coming to share this point of view.


This view has been a dominant position in the fine art since the 
early 20th century. In literary art this is basic ever since of 
course. So the end "artists are coming to share this point of view." 
is, I think, not appropriate. Especially in russian constructivism it 
hasn't been exactly "romanticism" that made language influential in 
the visual and acoustic art, but rather modernism, anti-romanticism, 
structuralism.

Possible solution:

In 20th century art, language, laws and rules have been a major 
subject of reflection and many artists have been using symbolic 
systems in their work. The fact that computers are symbolic machines 
has made them interesting evironments for artistic reasoning and 
production.


>The new wave of artistic programmers however are once more demanding 
>conversational programming interfaces, where someone can not only 
>change their mind while thinking, but also change the computer 
>program while it runs,

I think it is not that the artists are "demanding interfaces", but 
they (we) are constructing programming environments, languages, etc. 
Also "A new wave of artistic programmers" sounds too pretentious for 
my taste. I feel that the main idea I had with this sentence is a bit 
lost - let's keep it separate (sorry, Nick!).

>and make this thought process visible to everyone else.

maybe: share this thought process with others.

>This is live coding - adding instructions to a computer program 
>step-by-step, and having the computer run those instructions on the 
>fly, taking on changes without restarts.

Could be less technical for people who are not engineers or programmers, maybe?


>Live coders make writing software an explicit part of the creative 
>process, fully embracing source code as an expressive medium with 
>instant feedback

Suggestion: replace "fully embracing source code as an expressive 
medium with instant feedback"
by: "so that code is not the precondition, but the immediate medium 
of experiment and improvisation"

>Live coding renders practicable what many forms of sonic/visual 
>exploration strive to materialize;

this sounds as if live coding is not an art form / a way of research, 
but a technical means. I tend to avoid this, because it reduces the 
scope to a technical problem.

One more thing: while this is not the emphasis of LOSS Livecode, 
there is a scientific aspect to livecoding which should be not 
entirely ignored - of course it could be explicitly excluded.

>In short, livecoding is where musicians and artists of all talents 
>can express themselves artistically through immediate computer 
>programming.

could we replace this by:

"In short, livecoding is programming-as-art, as well as 
programming-as-research. It is the end of both instrumentalisation 
and the instrumentalisation of the end."

specially expression seems problematic, because it assumes something 
that is to be expressed before the process - (for good or bad 
reasons) in many fields of art, expression has a certain bad taste as 
a result.

creative process is ok, I think.
I myself tend to call it artistic reasoning, or research process, or 
experimentation.


I hope I haven't put anyone off by my comments - they are just suggestions!

Hi all,

We (Andrew Sorensen, Julian Rohrhuber and I) have been working on the

We'd like to know a little bit about what you'd want to use this session
for, and the kind of things that would be most beneficial to the
participants.

Firstly, is a hands on workshop useful (covering basic programming and
more juicy possibilities later), or are you all hardcore hackers who want
to use the time to discuss the features of the 3 livecoding systems
(Supercollider, Impromptu and Fluxus) in more of a presentation/panel
format?

Another possiblitity is to use the time for a kind of open ended jam, wit=

lots of projectors and discussions, but no real plan.

Your input is most appreciated!

I've just spent this afternoon at a 'workshop' that was anything but; just 
panel presentations. Still interesting, but not practical. I vote

discussions. As much as possible, the opportunity to try out the different 
systems under author's guidance would be great.

Maybe others disagree, but I think calling it a 'workshop session' when its 
really a panel is misleading.

Hi all,
this is Jim from Access space calling- to say hi to you all- say that I am
here for any special requests and to try and get things sorted from the
Sheffield end...

A quick overview of the options and possibilities (Alex- I will chat to you
later today- sorry I missed your calls yesterday).

Ok- so space wise- access space is of moderate size. We have about 12
networked computers (of moderate spec- they have all been built from donated
and recycled bits) running on Mandriva at the moment. It may be that none of
these are needed but it may be that all of them are. Most of them currently
have sound running on them- (Alsa) and we are contantly trying to keep them
up to date etc. They can all run Supercolllider. Some of them run Jack
although we have been charting the incompatibility of hardware with this. We
have one projector constantly available- and more can be sourced with
accurate numbers. Size wise- it would comfortably seat about 20-25 people
and could be pushed to hold more although it would then get very intimate!

We also have the possibility of using another space as well as access space.
We can get hold of a larger empty space at SIF (Sheffield Independent Film)
just down the road- this would be good for some performances etc although we
would need to hire equipment- PA etc- think they have a projector in the
space that we can use.

In terms of the rest- any requests to make this as enjoyable for everybody-
and I will try my best to sort.

With regards to the friday session... I think the workshops would work well
as hands on etc and then maybe moving towards a more of a jam session...
then leading into food and the evenings entertainment. Worshop content- am

Hi All,

I'm thinking about buying a projector, both for live coding (text

everything, high quality image, bright, small, light, tough, cheap  
etc.. :)  I don't know much (anything really) about these beasts and  
the range of options is pretty overwhelming so I'm not sure what to  
buy.  I would love to hear any thoughts/suggestions/experiences you  
have!

Cheers,

yes I agree with Nick here, there will be plenty of time for

we're not all programming and/or linux experts, certainly not during

as above, surely this would naturally come sometime after the sat  
presentations?

I'd vote for something like a gentle _hands-on_ introduction to the  
main systems in turn, the main emphasis could be getting simple  
things running on peoples machines, the more theoretical issues would  
be kept for later.

This would mean though some organisation in advance so everyone could  
have the appropriate builds on their own machines?... Perhaps some  
clear links/instructions on the wiki so we could come prepared? Would  
something like this be feasible?

I'd prefer something more structured as above, there are plenty of

Well, we do have access to some machines we could potentially install
software on, I need to find out more about that. I think that would be
ideal, as it doesn't restrict the workshop to people with laptops - also
we can install workshop material ready to use.

I was also thinking of bringing a bunch of pure:dyne CD's which will
boot on any intel machine (I think) and contain supercollider and
fluxus, but that doesn't help with impromptu.

cheers,

dave

An excerpt from an email from Jim re equipment for the friday workshops;

"Equipment wise- I need to draw up a possible equipment list soon. We
have two video projectors- I found another one today in access space-
that made me happy! The sound sytem in access is not bad. We have a few
sets of good computer speakers- perhaps 5 and more that are just
average. We have 10 networked medium spec computers running Mandriva
2006 or 2007. Most have reasonable sound capabilities and will be able
to run some software such as Supercollider and can try others if I know
what."

So seems good but we'll have to have reserved places I think - there
will be ~ 25 presenters/performers alone

Looking forward to it :)

That sounds good. I'm not sure if we have any idea about numbers yet - it
might be an idea to add a tickbox to the registration to get an estimate =
-
just single or double figures would be good.

Sounds like we'll need fluxus installed on those machines if we are able
to - version 0.12 ideally, but 0.11 might have easier, it doesn't matter
too much either way. Are you the right person to ask to do this?

I'm in favour of getting stuff on your machines rather than relying on
people to install on theirs beforehand, given the short time availible it
would be a shame to waste it on an installfest.

In workshops I've given before I've just covered the very basics of schem=
e
and some graphics - intended for people with no programming experience. I
was worried that this would be too basic, but it sounds like it might be
appropriate for this too, it's easier in some ways to teach the more
advanced stuff - in the event that people are interested, we have enough
time.

Hi Dave and all,
I can definately give the Fluxus a whirl and see how easy / what
dependencies it requires. If it seems like a complete nightmare to install
on all of our different machines then Pure:Dyne would be good idea- tried to
get Aymeric to come but he will be on a Basque holiday which is a shame.

I am not sure how many beginners we will have. My instincts are that the

Email me offlist for help with that, it would be great to have it
installed. Pure:Dyne was my initial thinking as the easiest route - I'm
going to bring some CD's for people with their own machines anyway.

Well, if we are teaching _live coding_ per se, my fluxus scheme livecodin=
g
is extremely simple, trying to get the most visually from the absolute
mimimum code - so it might/should be suitable for beginners anyway.

Julian - you've done a lot of this sort of thing before haven't you?
what's your current thinking?

Andrew, I'm still interested in sharing the scheme stuff - maybe we could
do something system agnostic at the start on the wonders of scheme live
coding, and then dive into the music/graphics afterwards...

It would be great to get chuck too... and as many of the other various
systems on as possible. We should talk about this on the fluxus or
pure:dyne list - but we should be able to install 0.12 without PLT if
needbe (mzscheme only).

Earlier I was a small part of something called "Assembly", 11th in a
series of large group improvisations organised by Adem
(http://adem.tv/).

The improvisers could bring their own instrument or use one provided by
Adem.  There were plenty of instruments to go around, and the audience
was invited to join the improvisation.  There were probably around 20
improvisers.  Electric powered instruments (such as laptops) weren't
allowed.

Then Adem and others took turns to write instructions on a large
blackboard.  An instruction would be written, and a signal would be made
to enact it.  Sometimes an earlier instruction would be pointed at and
re-enacted.  Some instructions were later modified.  Some instructions
had loops (play long sounds, then short sounds, repeat).  Some
instructions were just abstract shapes.

It worked very well.  I'm afraid it was rather dark, so my camera phone
pictures of the board afterwards didn't come out too well:

YES!  it's good; get it if you have any interest in end-user  
programming (of which I consider livecoding a cornerstone).

'The Humane Interface' by Jef Raskin is also interesting, especially  
with the renewed commercial interest in Zooming User Interfaces (e.g.  
iPhone / Core Animation, Microsoft's Photosynth and FTIR table called  
"Surface", etc.)

I've found that live coding is very suitable for learning. We should 
not make such a strong difference between beginners and experts, 
anyway we don't know each other's systems so well, so there is a lot 
to look at anyway.

I ran a human improvisers live coding session with Brighton improvising

Subject: [livecode] xxxxx call 2007
From: m <m
Date: Wed, 20 Jun 2007 15:19:10 +0100



xxxxx call 2007

xxxxx call for participation in a speculative 12 hour life coding
event (organising hardware and software) to be held in Mid-November
as part of the Piksel festival in Bergen, Norway:

http://www.piksel.no/

Deadline for email submission: July 31st 12AM [midnight]

Life coding is a mapping of the descriptive means of hardware and
programming onto the world. In this instance it includes the invention
and construction of models and language to actively describe and code
the event; instructing, structuring, re-structuring and constructing
the 12 hours. Life coding is obviously influenced by the existence of
programming, fiction, scripting and execution.

Participation is not limited to potential forms including:

-	      performative presentations

-	      advanced participatory workshops

-	      actions

-	      interventions

The above will be assembled into shifts which move between hardware,
interface and (life) code. Proposals should suggest which shift would
be suitable. Proposed topics for shifts include open hardware in
relation to control, the world as interface, material as question of
substance (soft/hard), and the relation of technology, code and
pornography.

Please submit an introduction to your area of research/practise as
well as examples of projects, performances, texts, proposals for
advanced participatory workshops, performative presentations,
actions, interactions, interventions and email your entry to:

m@hiddenorg

xxxxx

Further information on the event:

xxxxx [2007] is proposed and wilfully structured as a 12 hour life
coding event within the context of previous xxxxx activities (Crash
2005, xxxxx 2006), and influenced by Plenum (collaboration with KOP,
2006).

xxxxx [2007] will exist as a major, inspired durational, performative
event allowing for exchange and construction between invited
international participants who truly exist on the bleeding edge of
what could be termed contemporary Crash culture.

xxxxx [2007] expands software and hardware with a wilful emphasis on
construction, an interface between theory and the active entry of
making' in the world.

xxxxx [2007] as event manifests a free software-led, coded structure
of self-organisation, and unique working groups. Although some of
these events will be ongoing (for example several working groups, and
background material), the 12 hours will be assembled by way of
shifts.

From: alex <alex

"Katahdin is a programming language where you can define new language
constructs such as expressions and statements as easily as new types or
functions. For example, you could define a new operator, a new type of
loop, implement a syntax from another language that you like. After
defining a new construct you can use it on the next line in the same
file, so there is no need to recompile each time you want to add a new
construct. Katahdin is powerful enough that you can define an entire
existing language, or design a new language from scratch, making
Katahdin a universal language interpreter."

hmm... technically, I'm not sure how this is different from most other
programming languages... operators and statements are just "weird"
functions, AFAIK.  (of course, the fact that languages such as C are
implemented to make these very difficult to interchange is another

ah, now this sounds an awful lot like FORTH and its interactive
compiler (or "meta-compiler").

True, for example in haskell

  1 + 2

is the same as

  (+) 1 2

and

  frob 1 2

is the same as

  1 `frob` 2

It is just syntactic sugar to help people with natural languages that
evolved with funny word order :)

as you hint toward, the general point is in how far it is required to 
enter into the compiler itself to change the logic of the program in 
a non-trivial way. One shouldn't have to do this in a turing-complete 
language. On the other hand it is interesting to see what happens 
when it happens.

Object orientation in a way tries to abstract from the idea of a 
single compiler altogether (although there is one), and make every 
object a dispatch of a "sentence".

my understanding of "interactive programming" is that the distinction
between "programming language" (and thus applications) and "compiler"
need not exist at all.

sure...  because OOP is also a "shadow" of the Actor Model... (Alan
Kay was a student of Carl Hewitt, IIRC.)  so, yes, we get into
asynchronous message-passing concurrency and distributed systems
programming.  (of which I'm quite fond.)

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model

I've tinkered with learning Erlang for a few years, and recently I
started reading the Pragmatic Programmer's book on it.  so far I think
it's quite excellent for clarifying alot of murky issues about what's
really going on in Erlang.

They do exist in each instance, but they are a matter of perspective. 
But what do you mean when you say that the "programming language" 
equals the "applications" ? I would have agreed in the flexibility of 
the concept of interpretation / compilation, but isn't the 
language/application relation the connection which is at least 
nontrivial?

     Nope. Kay says the idea coalesced for him in 1966, and the
strongest influences were Simula (Kristen Nygaard) and Sketchpad (Ivan
Sutherland). Kay's article "The Early History of Smalltalk" is a fun
read, by the way.

     Normally I wouldn't speak up in this sort of conversation (it's
such a cliche for me by now ;), but that statement made me do a
double-take. :)  You might be thinking of Hewitt's influence on Sussman
et al with Scheme, not Kay.

     In a desperate attempt to say something on-topic, I'll agree that
(at least in Smalltalk as I see it), there is no distinction between
programming language and "application". Also, the number of angels that
can dance on the head of a pin is currently 42. ;)

Hewitt writes somewhere that the Actor model is influenced by Smalltalk, AFAIR.

computer programming becomes a performance art; improvising a
performance using the text of a dynamic programming language.

Access Space has commissioned new works specifically for LOSS Livecode
and the 2 days will feature performances, workshops, talks and
informal presentations.  The daytime sessions will include
introductory workshops and presentations on cutting edge music and
video livecoding environments including Fluxus, IXI Quarks,
SuperCollider, Impromptu and ChucK.  The evening sessions will feature
performances by livecoding pioneers as well as collaborative jamming
sessions.

Performers and presenters include; Robert Atwood, Jan Berkel, Sylvain
Le Beux, Oliver Bown, Alberto de Campo, Graham Coleman, Nick Collins,
Jamie Forth, Karsten Gebbert, Dave Griffiths, Tom Hall, Martin Howse,
Ryan Jordan, Jan-Kees van Kampen, Jonathan Kemp, Craig Latta, Thor
Magnusson, Mattin, Alex McLean, Fabrice Mogini, Click Nilson, Fredrik
Olofsson, Jim Prevett, Julian Rohrhuber, Andrew Sorensen, Adrian Ward,
Luke Whitmore, Renate Wieser, Matthew Yee-King.

Subject: [livecode] xxxxx list launch
From: m <m
Date: Tue, 10 Jul 2007 16:54:15 +0100



xxxxx list for life coding of events (ideas and announcements) and
discussion of life coding practice.

Subscription: https://www.bek.no/mailman/listinfo/xxxxx

Life coding is a mapping of the descriptive means of hardware and
programming onto the world, a concern with an interiority of the
project of rationalism (the CPU) which can be expanded with reference
to data sheets, instruction sets (for example) and an operating system
in its widest (divine) sense.

Life coding is a concrete practice (code brut) with evident links to
the science of endophysics (exteriority and ethics), Gnostic fiction
(paranoia in language as fiction), electromystical activity, EM
(electromagnetic) for city flaneur, and crash of entropic world-view
economy.

xxxxx list activity is not limited to these activities and ideas -
rather exploring a wider territory for this new constructivism.

With many thanks to BEK, Bergen, Norway for support.

Hi Ross (and other livecode festival goers)

Will be good to see you in Sheffield! I think Alex sent around 
individualised emails now with accommodation details. But Ross, if you're 
stuck on Friday/Saturday night, I'm sure I (and others) can provide 
emergency floor space (I'll be at the uni housing accommodation as I expect 
many others too, I assume smallish but comfortable enough student rooms).

Other than that, I once attended a conference in Sheffield with minimal 
budget. I slept on one sofa after being denied a greenhouse, then got a 
cheap room in a local pub for two nights.

looking forward to livecode!
Nick

Hi Ross,
i have just found this which seems interesting as a place to stay:
http://www.sheffmeditation.org.uk/about.html
It may do the trick or it may be just a little too zen - but may be worth a
ring- pretty cheap accom.

If you are still stuck then I am sure we can sort something out.

Best
Jim

Subject: [livecode] live coding and Erlang


I came across this on one of my Erlang blogs:
http://bc.tech.coop/blog/070713.html   " Live Code Update in Erlang"
Fairly technical and not directly applicable, but lots of good food for thought.
I am in the midst of learning Erlang, it is a very powerful language
with the notion of live coding built into it. Distributed concurrent
performances is a possibility. It bends my mind in pleasing ways.
Anyone else played with Erlang?

here is a quick intro:

My pleasure :)  As I told many people, Jim, James, Ina, Keith and others
at access space should receive the thanks for the smooth running,
excellent choice of venues etc.  The excellent workshops, presentations,
performances, curry, countryside and general good company and
inspirational natter is what really made the weekend though!

For the benefit of absent friends and the memory impaired, if anyone has
slides/notes etc from their presentations it would be really good to
have them online, maybe linked from here:
  http://toplap.org/index.php/ToplapPapers

If anyone wants somewhere to upload let me know.

cheers

Thanks to everyone - it was a weekend of greatness!

Lots to think about too, it was great to see such a wide variety in
approaches to livecoding being described and performed - and plenty of
directions to explore.

JA JA!

It was a great weekend!

I want to see some pictures of the slub performance !!!!

What happened to the photographer? Did he end up in a cave in the  
swampy countryside?

Bring him back and force him to upload the rest of the pictures : )

It was fantastic to meet you all as always.

It was great to meet everyone and to see and hear about so many inspiring 
projects and perspectives.

Congratulations and thanks to all for an excellent event.

Subject: Re: [livecode] livecoded gameshow


this is great! I suggest we discuss the future of TOPLAP using this 
system...

It's good to recognise the live coding inherent in parliamentary bodies and 
other unruly mobs who vote on their own voting procedures; thought I guess 
that the consequences of such actions don't usually go backwards in time to 
alter previous votes... a democracy in Julian's new historical space time 
might have strange implications!

(the more humans are involved with rules, the more political it might get; 
an overly political live coding audiovisual performance might happen soon 
enough!)

As discussed on the side at the festival (and related to much political 
legislation), perhaps a further human live coding step is legal live 
coding, carried out during people's trials. Lawyers have been practising 
specifying actions in minute detail, and whilst they don't (and in some 
cases can't) always succeed in pinning things down perfectly, they may have 
some interesting tactics we could look into.

In common with these we're also working towards the (life) coding of
an event (12 hours in Bergen 17th November as part of Piksel). We're
interested in devising such coding strategies and will try and start
this discussion on the xxxxx list (below) centring on
possible/concrete strategies.

One aspect of the work examines the potential for some kind of
collaborative/remote intervention within display or presentational software
commonly used in seminar/symposium/workshop. My own experiments have
made use of Emacs Lisp as base (and as potential collaborative live
coding environment) but if anyone knows of other such projects I'd be
interested to hear.

At the same time our open call (equally for life coders to participate
in coding the event) is ... open until the 31st of July!

While on the wiki I thought I'd add an introduction to the front page:

"TOPLAP exists to promote the writing and modifying of rules while they
are followed. This includes the writing of software while it is being
executed, allowing programmers to improvise music and visuals live
before an audience as well as conduct exploratory research with live
source code."

Please edit until it is correct and reads well!

Usually the front page is protected so only admins can edit it, due to
past spamming incidents.  I've removed the protection but might have to
put it back - if you have problems editing get me (or another admin) to
upgrade you to admin.

     Don't worry, I don't delude myself that this is a democratic group.
:)  I just want to make sure I don't miss any opportunities for
participation that do happen to be open to me (even though, as in the
case of Sheffield 2007, I can't always participate).

Well it is like a really broken speech synth.  

It seems in this area there's an important balance to be struck.  On one
hand you don't want to necessarily make music with a speech synth,
because it's too much like a human voice.  It's like it's difficult to
stop yourself trying to search for meaning and listen to the sound.

On the other hand I want the ease of composing sounds with text, where I
can easily play around with words, having some idea of what a word will
sound like.  Also the results are a bit like speech, so hopefully a
listener can quickly get used to how the sounds are constructed and
relate to each other, because these relationships are similar to human
words/speech.

I guess it's also a bit like the idea of an 'uncanny valley' in
robotics.  Broken speech synthesis sounds nice, but if it's more like
human speech, it just sounds rubbish in comparison, or maybe even
menacing.

On the technical side, the Karplus-Strong algorithm is just a delay loop
with a filter, with feedback.  You put some white noise in the delay
loop, it feeds back on itself but because of the filter quickly smooths
out (rather than making the usual nasty feedback whistles).  This acts
and sounds much like a real plucked string does, which is why it's
called physical modelling synthesis.

Once I made that I took two parameters; the length of the delay loop and
the probability 'blend' value that controls how 'drumlike' it sounds.  I
picked a pair of values for these parameters for each consonant in the
English alphabet, my aim being to find a good range of sounds that sound
a bit like the letters I'm assigning them to, so fricatives harsher and
more percussive than more open sounds.

For the vowels I'm just applying a formant filter which really does make
it sound like human vowels.

I think what makes interesting sounds though are 'articulations'.  I'm
not switching between the parameter values, but moving between them
quickly, creating diphthong type effects.

and who needs LPC or concatenative synthesis when you can make good use of

Alex, you're aware of the component of the Cylob Music system for speech 
synthesis aren't you?

<http://durftal.com/cms/vocal%20sequencer.html>

he doesn't theorise it in terms of live coding and the possibilties you 
show in the video, but it might be worth referencing? He uses a DIY speech 
synthesis approach like you that gives speech with (uncanny?) character, 
having spent a long obsessive time himself mapping out English phones...

My pleasure, I'm looking forward to trying it out in 'performance'.  By
the way once I have a proper working system in a couple of weeks it
would be great to get some user feedback, so if anyone in London or at
the dorkcamp doesn't mind sit before it, playing with it and maybe
filling out a questionnaire that'd be great...  And once the thesis is
handed in I'll release it under a GPL.

No I wasn't, thanks a lot!  I've dropped him a mail asking if there are
any recordings of it in use...

Ace!  I'm a real stickler for obsessive mapping although my own mapping
only took about 10 minutes, I just used a mouse to pick values for the
two parameters that were a bit like each consonant.  Yep definitely
worth referencing.  Another good reference in this area is David Evan
Jones, who wrote a couple of interesting papers about work by himself
and others using speech in music.  The ones I've found so far are
"Speech Extrapolated" and "Compositional Control of Phonetic/Nonphonetic
Perception".

Exactly!

Maybe I should change my thesis title...  "A system for humans typing
sounds that computers try to make sound like a human trying to sound
like a computer making some music"

Cylob says his next album will have the vocal synth on - really nice
sample here:
  http://www.myspace.com/cylobformantpotaton

I love his stuff.

BTW there's going to be some software for modelling how a human uses
this broken speech synth language and making edits based on it.  So I
think the full alternative title for my thesis should be  "A system for
humans typing sounds that a computer tries to make sound like a human
trying to sound like a computer making music, with software to act like
a human doing so."

Thanks Amy :)

Subject: [livecode] beginning livecoding - questions


hello all,

my name is Josh, and this is officially my second post to the list.
:)  I am a musician and linux user, and would like to get into
livecoding.  alas, I also need to learn perl for my day job.  after
looking at the toplap wiki, I see that these two could go
hand-in-hand.

I've read the document called "hacking perl in nightclubs," but I
still have some questions about how to begin to use perl to create
music.  for example, I assume that perl has no synthesis capabilities
within itself; what will actually make sounds?  I see that perl will
handle most any OSC-enabled synths, so any recommendations here would
be great.

I know I'm asking simplistic questions, and I appreciate any advice
that you can give (even answering questions I don't have yet!).  I see
this as a great motivation to learn something that I can use in two
places in my life, I just need a little kick-start to get me moving.

thanks all,

josh

Subject: Re: [livecode] beginning livecoding - questions


hey Josh,

the easiest way is to communicate with osc, so you need a "backend" to
handle synthesis stuff (any osc capable app - csound, max/msp. pd.
sc3, etc etc).  of course you *could* write your own synth engine +
couple that with a scripting lang, there was a couple floating around
(i think pulsecode was one i saw) but this is definitely more work
than you really need to do.

In my opinion, the best way to get going is to start firing off some
simple scripts first that create musical (via osc) events and then
progress into more realtime scenarios.

The downside of using a language like perl is that it isn't dynamic,
in the sense that it cant easily be modified on the fly.  the
livecode.pl script gets around that by using some clever little tricks
to create a self-modifying loop.  so if your interested in using perl
specifically then checking out the work done there would be a good
start.

Having said that I'm not a perl guru, so others on this list will no
doubt be able to give you more info.

cheers,

James

Subject: [livecode] LOSS Livecode Festival recordings
Date: Fri, 17 Aug 2007 13:15:59 +0100


Hello All

I have recordings from the Rutland Arms, Sheffield, 2007-07-20
where a splendid time was had by all.

Recordings are performances by

	Ross Bencina (recorded from the desk)
	RedFrik (recorded from the desk)
	PBUnplugged (ambient pub conversation mix recording)

(Recording of first performer didn't work out unfortunately)

Suggestions of what to do with these?
Clearance from performers needed before these can be hosted somewhere.
Favoured audio format?


Regards

Tom

Hi Tom (and all),

I hope you are all good and sorry for my lack of contact over the past
weeks- I have been taking the opportunity for some rest time, fun and sun in
Helsinki... I would recomend to all :)

I would like to say thank you to all who took part in LOSS Livecode and that
it was a pleasure to meet you all and hear what you are all up to. One of
the biggest aims of the festival was to get people together who are
interested in the same area and support an interesting and blossoming area
of audio production. In this sense I think it has been a total success. Just
the fact that this email list has been so active is a great acheivement...
although this is also a development of Toplap!

The recordings- my suggestion would be to host them all together. I just
asked Alex about the recordings from the pub today- so fantastic.  I have
all the recordings from the Live night and have been cleaning them up. I
currently have them in wav format and was going to put them on the LOSS
website as ogg (as this fits with open our ethos etc). I can however give
the wav formats to anyone who wants them. What I want to get is  clearance /
agreements from everybody to do this. Currently the LOSS website is only
hosting the old CD tracks that are all released under teh Creative Commons
sampling plus license. The LOSS website is currently being re-worked so LOSS
becomes a banner for interesting projects... hence the LOSS Livecode. I will
be collating all the documentation / links to this on this site and I will
also put the  recordings here also (subject to clearance). In the meantime,
until this website is completed, I would suggest that I simply put all of
these on a seperate page where all of those involved can listen... what say
you?

Another possibility is to see what budget we have left and make a CD of
these. This would obviously take time though.

One last thing to say is... if you enjoyed this event- then please give me
feedback- I know some of you have already and thanks, but the more we get
the more justification we have of doing it / something similar again.

My best wishes to you all
Jim

ps- invoices are being processed as we speak!

Hey Tom

I'm happy for this to be put online somewhere under a non-noncommercial CC 
licence. I wouldn't mind a FLAC version for myself, but mp3 is probably good 
for most...

If you don't find a central home for these let me know..

LOSS livecoders,

It was excellent to meet everyone, and to see a diversity of systems,
techniques, and aesthetics surrounding livecoding.

Many thanks to Jim, Alex, and everyone at Access Space.

Thank you much for hosting. Before this event I had only met a handful of
livecoders, whereas at  LOSS livecode it was excellent to meet plenty system
builders and performers.

The recordings- my suggestion would be to host them all together. I just

Sampling plus seems like the right thing. I consent to this, though I'd love
to get a lossless or uncompressed version as well.

Having different formats for each event (workshop, pub concert, talks, club
night, walk) was an  excellent idea. I'm keeping my ears peeled for word of
next year's festival.

Fantastic job,

Graham

Dear Jim

Just to say - I am happy to have my loss livecode session released under
the CC license. Not sure what the sampling bit means, but if it means
macdonalds owe me a fiver when they use it to sell nitro burgers in 2156
then that's fine I'm sure.

the problem being it got a bit popular via a post to

ha!
solving recursion problems by boredom is a very modern approach 
indeed: "The only real problem with a quine in this format is that it 
could easily lead to infinite recursion, until the interpreters get 
bored." The boredom parameter should be part of any indeterministic 
system.

I'd be really up for that.  The synthdef is using the Haskell client
libraries, I can send you that or try to duplicate it in sclang...  It's
a really simple patch anyway

I don't know if GAs can live code, maybe we can do the usual cop out and
call it artificial live coding. :)

I very much enjoyed these, the range of techniques and aproaches keeps it
all exciting; wonderfull performances.

Listening to these was a bit like I felt as a child listening to the radio,
with the lack of visual cues giving a added sense of anticipation. Still, I
do think it would be good to give some thought to what form downloads of
livecoding performances should idealy take. I don't think there are ready
made formats for audio with sub-titles but that's roughly what I imagine
would be a interesting idea.

Kas,

Supercollider seems to have a system for logging the code that goes to the
server, the History class. In so far as you could use that to re-render a
performance, you could potentially render it to some video format. Fredrik
has already posted some of his history.

ChucK does not have a system for logging code sent to the VM, but I can see
no reason why something like that could not be added.

I think a screencast is a good format for this, but it's harder to do that
in actual live performance.

Andrew Sorenson has a good one here:

Yes, that would be interesting. I imagine Ge to be so swamped with requests,
ideas and sugestionsright now that we might as well ask for this in half a
year or so...

Some time back there was discussion here about a DVD or book. I think that
if a performance can be send to a projection monitor it can also be send to
a VCR, that wouldn't place any aditional strain on the performer or the
computer. I could imagine working with the DVD facilities for multiple
angles so the viewer could switch between seeing just the performer's
schreen and seeing the whole stage/context. So far many of the videos about
livecoding I've seen have been impressive, enjoyable and completely
unreadable.

That looks excelent and I'll watch that, the audio for this performance was
very polished indeed.

While we're at it, if you have some time, I'd be very interested in hearing
about what techniques you used for those counterpoint melodies in your own
set as well.

I definitely agree, I've been wanting to sort out a live coding dvd for
some time - would anyone be interested in making some movies for this? I
quite like the idea of rendering code to the subtitle layer :)

Live coding should be highly compressable - sc history is lossless and
tiny, fluxus does a similar thing to record key presses - and it also
does the same with the gamepad input (this is how I render movies -
offline at fixed framerate afterwards)

I haven't ever remembered to turn this on live - it never seems
important when you're trying to get (e.g.) syncing to work :) One way
around this is to log everything automatically, so all your histories
are stored without you having to think about it. 

cheers,

dave

you mean on the C/C++ side? things have got a lot easier with GL2 - I
waited till I had drivers that supported that, so I didn't have to mess
with extensions. it's really very easy, all the fluxus shader stuff goes
though this class:
http://cvs.savannah.nongnu.org/viewvc/fluxus/libfluxus/src/GLSLShader.h?r=
oot=3Dfluxus&view=3Dmarkup
http://cvs.savannah.nongnu.org/viewvc/fluxus/libfluxus/src/GLSLShader.cpp=
?root=3Dfluxus&view=3Dmarkup

I think the only thing it's dependant on is my colour/vector/matrix
classes and some searchpath stuff which call all easily be removed.

hi all,

I'm trying to figure out how to do livecoding tutorial videos for
fluxus, I'm not sure if it's really practical with the quality of online
video yet. I have some strange timing issues to figure out with the
offline frame rendering, and also it's just quite hard to do. Here's a
first attempt at the basic cubes thing:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O5DJTOy6EA

The originals (the avi and the actual keypress file - run fluxus-0.13 -p
secret-one.keys to see it play - on a cvs build of fluxus):

Let me know if you think this is of any use. I have 2 more to upload,
but they are about twice as long :/

Subject: [livecode] full slate live coding


here's a little something which Andrew, Andrew and I were discussing over 
dinner this week.

Rather than starting from a blank slate, you could begin with as much code 
as you're ever going to write. Then your task is to gradually delete 
instructions (like a game of jenga?). Perhaps you'd deconstruct, perhaps 
you'd destroy and subvert. But you might end the set by deleting the last 
consequential command and thus bring visualisation, audio or vibrotactile 
olfactoriness to an end.

This can of course dovetail with blank slate coding, indeed, the two can go 
in waves. Perhaps a timer controls the process and participants first build 
up, then down, swapping the hot seat.

A breakpoint envelope/control function might determine swap times and 
changes being creation and destruction. A up B down, B up, A down might 
form one variant. And so forth...

Plus, all the participants would wear waistcoats and stroke their chins as 
their opponent moved matters to tricky positions.

I don't really know if I understood your exemple very well, but here is=20
another idea (which I hope corroborate yours)
You can also imagine a chessboard reprensenting 16 processes for two=20
players, like this : Rook =3D bass drum, Knight =3D Snare, Bishop =3D Hi-=
Hat,=20
Queen =3D Melody, King =3D On/Off, Pawns =3D Polyphony
So, anytime you move a piece, a process begin (according to the=20
polyphony determined by pawns), then the X/Y place of the piece could be=20
the pitch and bpm. Anytime you eat a piece you gain either polyphony or=20
a defined synth, etc .. (I think you got the point to build up new rules)
Then the time swaps you are talking about would be determined by each tur=
n.
And, of course, this can be visualized with Fluxus ;D

My two cents

Subject: [livecode] livecoding localised code display


Dear Livecoders

I was livecoding at the Vortex Jazz club in Dalston, N London with my
friend Finn Peters' 'Finntet' the other day and I realised that there is
a need for a localised display of code. Think about a guitar player -
you can see what they are doing if you are reasonably close, but their
hands and guitar are not projected on a big screen behind them. I
considered bringing a flat panel 17 inch with me which I could place in
front of the laptop, facing towards the audience but couldn't carry it.
Maybe some sort of folding mirror arrangement which displays a
reflection of your screen out to the audience. Sitting with your back to
the audience so they can see your screen is another option... I think
Miles Davis used to do that sometimes, but for other reasons!

local displays are good, though the gestures don't scale up in the same way

the hub coded with the audience able to wander around their terminals

I heard a report of someone live coding to a monitor positioned near them, 
or even placed in the centre of the audience while they sat on stage, and 
we've discussed it on this list in the past, but I don't remember who did 
what...

I had to turn my laptop to the audience after (mentioning no names) messed 
up the dual projection of Nic vs Nick at NIME and crashed (mentioning no 
particular commonly used program). But the screen is too small even for 
people right near the stage I think.

Another way of looking at the "breakpoint" version is as a relay event,
where person 1 builds up a code base, passes over to person 2 who
deconstructs it down to a minimal amount, passes to person 3 who builds up,
etc.... Events could include 4x4 mixed medley - and other swimming
metaphors. Live coding team sports : )

Yes - I left my MIDI controller keyboard at home for my last gig,
preferring to code an elegant routine instead of twisting a knob. In
fact I turned up at a rehearsal for that gig and had even left my
computer at home. I figured the musicians in this case might not respond
well to the 'live coding with real musicians' techniques presented by
Nick C at the livecoding conference so I had to code from scratch using
a borrowed computer on which I had luckily,  previously installed SC3.
It's a shame that fashions move so fast in the livecoding world - I
thought I was really 'it', coding from scratch, then came home to read
the posts about coding from inverse-scratch on this list.

ps Dave - I have obtained some cheap USB joysticks for the purposes of
strange controller construction but hope to get an install of
betablocker on the go before I destroy the sticks with a soldering iron.

Yep I'm up for it.  I'm secretly getting some TOPLAP stickers done, I
should have them by then.

BTW I understand there were a couple of livecoding papers at ICMC, are
they available for general consumption?

Evan Raskob ran a live patching workshop at a dorkbot camp last weekend.
It worked well.  People wore instructions around their necks and pulled
on bungee cords to pass messages around.  We managed some fun
polyrhythms.

Well I don't have them yet, but all being well we should have a TOPLAP

I think they should be white, and be delivered with a washable marker, so you

I thought there used to be a programing version of those magnetic poetry

but I can't find it online anymore so maybe I imagined it.

This would be quite cool, actually, I'd buy it (more likely I'd presgang a

excellent - pester me for support (I don't think anyone has got

Interesting stuff - live visual programming is a very rich area to
explore. Thinking about programming this way can also improve the
usability of existing languages I think. 

I'm working on a graph programming language at the moment, but it's not
going to be much like pd (if it works at all). 

I was impressed with Roberts desire data performance at loss livecode -
I think there is something to be said for making livecoding more
accessible in this way - I don't know much pure data at all, but I
understood quite a bit about what he was doing.

Good morning, livecoding gurus!

This humble newbie has only discovered ChucK a
few hours ago, and is in dithered awe and excitement. unbearable
signals pass unfiltered from adc=>dac and
he cannot wait to ask of you:

 - how does one create dynamic graphics in ChucK?
 - can one couple ChucK with a Python GUI for this purpose?

The final project dataflow would probably look something like this:

audience mobile phone=>GUI game =>ChucK Mixer => GUI => audience mobile
phone

Any help would be deeply appreciated. Tutorials may be written for
newbies of the the future!

warm regards,

Good morning AlgoMantra

ok, I overslept so i can still say good morning, it might be a bit vain to
answer a question directed at livecoding gurus but I do know a thing or two
about ChucK. The first thing to do for you would be to sign up to the ChucK
list which can be found here;

http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/community/

I'd sign up to the main list (to hear about updates) and to the users list
which would be the best place to ask questions like the ones you have and
the ones that will arise. Questions are nice, they'll make people go "Oh, I
never thought about that" or "Hmmmm, that's a nice puzzle" so if you direct
them there they'll arrive where they are most appreciated.

The old masters said there are three main ways of accomplishing this;

First is standing right next to a exploding ChucK compiler, then marveling
at the litle stars and swirling colours, this is said to have been Tao Tse
ChucK's favourite method and he lived to be 120 years and had many beautiful
concubines.

Second is is getting something like Java or Python, basically anything
accessible with libraries for graphics and OSC.

Third is walking up the mountain and meditating there until "Ge" ("Ge" is
the name amongst ChucKist monks for the creative spirit that flows through
the world) delivers to you the "GlucK". Nobody has seen the GlucK yet but
according to prophecy it will be a OpenGL engine for ChucK. It's on "The
List" which is the sacred ChucKist book of "things that we will have in the
future if we remain faithful". It's probably our largest book, eclipsing
even the epic "Things that should be documented" tome.



>  - can one couple ChucK with a Python GUI for this purpose?


Yes, one can and the ChucK list has a few Python experts that might be able
to help you there.


The final project dataflow would probably look something like this:
>
> audience mobile phone=>GUI game =>ChucK Mixer => GUI => audience mobile
> phone


In that case I suspect using Processing (Processing.org) might be good. It's
Java, is aimed at graphics and has OSC. I believe mobile phones tend to have
the Java nature to a larger degree then the Python nature. The thing is that
I have taken a vow of mobile poverty and only use my mobile phone to make
calls if at all. The ChucK list has a few Processing people as well.



Any help would be deeply appreciated. Tutorials may be written for

Wonderful!
See you on the ChucK list.

Kassen the Kind! Your help is appreciated and
the advice has been acted upon. I had signed
up for the list but was waiting for it to stir awake.

I believe mobile phones tend to have the Java nature to a larger degree then
the Python nature.

Er..that is no more true, eversince Nokia opened up the Symbian platform to
Python. See
you on the ChucK users list.

The toplap wiki spam was really getting intolerable, so I'm afraid now
you have to register and login before editing a wiki page, and pass a

Hm, your system seems rather similar to my own.  I see now that the

have extra security stuff installed that stops this from working?  I'll
remove the captcha stuff in any case, if it doesn't work in everyone's

I could really do with feedback for this, both negative and positive, of
the screencast, the ideas behind it, and thoughts you have in response
to it, to help evaluate it for my msc thesis.  To list or private mail

I did disable some Javascripting that bothered me, like moving windows and
removing parts of the interface, etc (all standard Firefox settings), but
not speciffically cross-site scripting. I also checked my adblock but
adblock reported being offended by anything so it must be something else.


Another issue is that I can seem to find a way to have the WiKi send me the
password I had that I lost or give me a new one.

That would be nice.

If I were you, BTW, I'd considder how many spammers there are and how many
livecoders there are and conclude that manual account activation (following
a email) sounds quite sensible for Toplap.org, despite the appeal of
anonimous collaboration on a database.

I'm sorry, you're going to have to explain this, Google only came up with
some islands in Minnesota and I'd like to know what's going to be with me.
You know, in case I need to cook for more people or have shots or whatever.

In case there is confusion; "spork" is a ChucK command that starts a new
process parallel to the one you're calling from, this allows you to run two
endless loops next to each other, for example. I imagine it's a contraction
of "spawn" and "fork" but I might be wrong. "spork" can also be applied to a
wide range of non-programming contexts, right now I don't have the time to
go into the exact syntax and semantics of this.

Cheers,
Kas.

In fact I am.

I won't be livecoding the 21st but I'll be "live programming".

I'll be programming my home-build sequencer/drummachine through the use of
arcade-style game controllers, in fact I'll have to because I intentionally
didn't include pattern storage facilities in it.
The philosophy behind this is that with game-controllers you can take more
advantage of muscle memory then with a X0X style interface which
could/should open up more bandwidth between the performer and the data in
the sequencer thus enabling me to move out of the "presentation of
pre-prepared material" idea that's so boring about most dance-music
performances.

I developed this out of ChucK, some Nord Modular patches (that are kinda
interwoven with the ChucK structure) and a set of game controllers through
Playstation => USB converters. ( HORI "real arcade pro" joystick and two
"beatmania" controllers, for those into that sort of thing). Also; there is
no graphical feedback, partially to focus on the sound, partially to deal
with it all on a more physical level.

The positive side to this is that it's very live and exciting to do and at
times quite intuitive, the downside is that it's also kinda easy to mess up,
more or less like livecoding but to a lesser degree. In fact I would be
quite surprised if there weren't one or two songs that would degrade into a
monotonous unstructured mess. I urgently need about a year's worth of daily
practice with this but I'm improving, lately...

So, that's it, not quite completely off-topic. The concept could be taken
further, for example by combining it with livecoding but my current setup is
quite coherent so it'll take a very good new idea before I change a lot
about it, not in the last place because I need more experience with this
fairly simple form.

I'm planning to attend the Saturday SC gig and see what people are up to, I
noticed Cylob is playing so I'm interested in that because he also wrote his
own sequencer and I'm quite curious about Fredrik.

Cheers,
Kas.

In fact I am.<br><br>I won&#39;t be livecoding the 21st but I&#39;ll be &quot;live programming&quot;.<br><br>I&#39;ll be programming my home-build sequencer/drummachine through the use of arcade-style game controllers, in fact I&#39;ll have to because I intentionally didn&#39;t include pattern storage facilities in it.
<br>The philosophy behind this is that with game-controllers you can take more advantage of muscle memory then with a X0X style interface which could/should open up more bandwidth between the performer and the data in the sequencer thus enabling me to move out of the &quot;presentation of pre-prepared material&quot; idea that&#39;s so boring about most dance-music performances.
<br><br>I developed this out of ChucK, some Nord Modular patches (that are kinda interwoven with the ChucK structure) and a set of game controllers through Playstation =&gt; USB converters. ( HORI &quot;real arcade pro&quot; joystick and two &quot;beatmania&quot; controllers, for those into that sort of thing). Also; there is no graphical feedback, partially to focus on the sound, partially to deal with it all on a more physical level.
<br><br>The positive side to this is that it&#39;s very live and exciting to do and at times quite intuitive, the downside is that it&#39;s also kinda easy to mess up, more or less like livecoding but to a lesser degree. In fact I would be quite surprised if there weren&#39;t one or two songs that would degrade into a monotonous unstructured mess. I urgently need about a year&#39;s worth of daily practice with this but I&#39;m improving, lately...
<br><br>So, that&#39;s it, not quite completely off-topic. The concept could be taken further, for example by combining it with livecoding but my current setup is quite coherent so it&#39;ll take a very good new idea before I change a lot about it, not in the last place because I need more experience with this fairly simple form.
<br><br>I&#39;m planning to attend the Saturday SC gig and see what people are up to, I noticed Cylob is playing so I&#39;m interested in that because he also wrote his own sequencer and I&#39;m quite curious about Fredrik.

act of a flowing; a continuous moving on or passing by, as of a flowing
stream; a continuous succession of changes

A graphical livecoding environment for Scheme. Builds for Linux (and
sometimes OSX), and released under the GPL licence.

http://www.pawfal.org/fluxus/

http://www.pawfal.org/Software/fluxus/files/fluxus-0.13rc2.tar.gz

A big refactoring and clean up of the renderer, including some new
features:

* Stencil buffer shadowing
* Stereo support (thanks to Alex Norman)
* Skeleton animation and skinning
* A GLSL shader library with some common illumination models
* A long awaited torus primitive!
* More control over the render loop for full screen effects 

Also lots of changes to the scratchpad live coding editor, including:

* TrueType font support
* Much better integrated documentation
* Portuguese doc translations (thanks to Glauber Alex Dias Prado)
* Built in easy access TOPLAP manefesto
* Text 'autofocus' zooming/tracking
* Live code recording and playback with key press files

There is also a new series of tutorial livecoding movies, to give you
some ideas about live coding strategies using Scheme and fluxus:
http://www.pawfal.org/index.php?page=FluxusSecrets

And the C++ API has been documented, for people wishing to use the
fluxus renderer directly:

As I remember, the patches weren't really changed while they were
running.  I guess it needed some time for everyone to get used to the
idea before that was possible.  It would add a lot though -
self-modifying instructions and self-reconfiguring patches would be
nice!

One 'problem' that became clear is that there was no clear distinction
between message passing (ie counting) and the 'musical' output.  The
messages became part of the music.

The '89 volt shock' instruction was a reference to a real electrical
current that passed through many people until we realised that some
dodgy electrics in the scout hut was causing a whole table to be live...

Hi,

It was good to meet up with some of you last week at the Foundry. I was
chatting to David a bit about the pre-history of livecoding and was
telling him about the Scratch Orchestra who were a music and performance
collective who existed in London in the late 1960's, for more background
see:

    http://www.stefan-szczelkun.org.uk/PHD-SCRATCH2.htm

One of the works they published was a set of performance scores called
"Nature Study Notes" (1969), one of the scores is an early example of
live-life-coding:

"Use any means to decide on a conductor.  He is set up in front and
asked to improvise soundlessly.  The rest read him like a score and play
accordingly."

Interestingly "Nature Study Notes" also has an early form of copyleft
license on it, which not only allows for copies but also encourages
people to make modifications and additions to the scores which can be
incorporated into later versions:

"No rights are reserved in this book of rites.  They may be reproduced
and performed freely.  Anyone wishing to send contributions for a second
set should address them to the editor: C.Cardew, 112 Elm Grove Road,
London SW13."

Another piece of livecoding pre-history is the group Exit, who existed
around the same time and performed with graphic scores that were often
drawn live during performance. Two of the main members of Exit were
Penny Rimbaud and Gee Vaucher who later went on to be part of the
anarcho-punk band Crass - Yves Degoyan would be proud (or mortified
...). You can find more info on Exit in George Berger's book "The Story
of Crass".

Anyway this is stuff I'm covering in an article for the FLOSS+Art book
so will send a copy on when it's done .... I am also giving a version of
it as a talk in London next January, so will maybe see you back in the
Foundry some point soon ....

best wishes

I'd really like to see consoles used for more creative purposes, so I
like this a lot. That is a _huge_ difference between kids in the
Commodore era and today, that invitation to hack - the blinking cursor,
I want live coding to be a similar invitation.

Starlogo is a similar effort (from Mitchel Resnick's group at MIT, the
original LOGO guys) with similar goals:
http://education.mit.edu/starlogo-tng/
A version of this is on the OLPC:
http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Turtle_Art
It also forked into the lego mindstorms language some years ago.

It's interesting to see Microsoft in this area.

I wonder what these people would make of live coding - I'm really
interested in this intersection of games, coding, performance and also
education - I agree, they share an immense amount.

Subject: [livecode] control scsynth from python


hi again

Just released ...

SC package for Python :
Easily control SuperCollider sound server from Python.

SC allows to easily control Supercollider sound server (scsynth) from
Python.  It wraps scsynth / scosc libraries by Patrick Stinson
(http://trac2.assembla.com/pkaudio). SC provides with a simpler API  to
use those libraries. However advance users might want to bypass SC and
use those libraries directly.

Using SC, Supercollider Synthdefs can be loaded into the scsynth server
therefore can be totally controlled from python.
New synthdefs can be instantiated in real time and its sound conections
can be changed. SC can also be used from  interactive Python to do live
coding (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_coding).

Download it from :
- source, docs and examples
http://www.ixi-software.net/content/download/sc/sc-0.1.zip
- windows package installer
http://www.ixi-software.net/content/download/sc/sc-0.1.win32.exe

I am getting some small errors in some cases on windows but i think they
are caused by the version of psycollider I am running. I have to check
this better. Please report errors. thanks.

Final license is GLP because patrick stinson's libraries are GPL

Well, I've never thought about programming in terms of text - even when
writing very mundane C++. I think about it in terms of interacting
entities and boxes, which then have to be translated into whatever
programming language I'm using.

I should be programming in UML really, but somehow I've never got on very
well with it - or dataflow langauages for that matter.

From: "Dave Griffiths" <dave


That's interesting, I've been playing around with FRP a bit lately, it
seems well suited for live coding.

I'm currently writing an interface for PLT's FrTime
(ftp://ftp.cs.brown.edu/pub/techreports/03/cs03-20.pdf) for using fluxus
this way.

Very interesting and a fun read. Thanks!

Most of the examples of programming in games that have been mentioned on the
list so far have related to relatively old and relatively obscure games that
don't seem to have mass market appeal right now.

So; I would like to point out that Final FantasyXII which is fairly recent
and is very popular indeed has a system for programming friendly AI.

In this game you control a group of young warriors that travel and get in a
lot of battles. Unlike previous versions ("Final" is getting quite silly as
a word here) combat is in realtime. The catch is that the player doesn't
have to control all actions by all active friendly characters explicitly and
can instead use a simple but relatively versatile set of rules to form a
sort of AI for his characters.

Aside from the evident mainstream appeal of this game another aspect that
might be interesting here is the way this system is woven into the gameplay.
In FinalFantasy the player can discover and acquire items like magical
swords but in this version the player can similarly find or "buy" new
instructions. These are fairly simple, no loops or recursion or exceptions
or whatever, we are talking about stuff in the order of "target; a sleeping
enemy" which will allow one to construct a rule that basically expresses "if
you see a sleeping enemy try to steel loot from him", the character will do
this unless some other rule is more important at that moment (this is
expressed by the order in which they are placed) but the way in which all of
this is integrated with the rest of the game is somewhat interesting.

I wonder to what degree this mechanic will use the rather common situation
of gamers cursing at friendly AI controlled characters  to introduce
programming as a concept to people who might otherwise never encounter it,
this might be a strong incentive to some.

My cent(s),
Kas.

That's really interesting, I haven't played any of the FF series for quit=
e
some time now. I wonder how far they will take this.

According to wikipedia:

"It&#333; drew inspiration for gambits from plays in American football
where each team member has a specific job to do based on the conditions
and desired outcome."

Sounds like it's worthy of further investigation for non-computer live
coding :)

The only similar thing I've seen like this are the controls for "The Sims=
"
where you stack up instructions in order, but they are not conditional.

cheers,

dave

Not far enough, so far, in my opinion.

Interesting in how it works out in practice is that it doesn't have
facilities for more complicated expressions; it's always;

if (x) then do (y)

So, if we have a rule that says especially large enemies should be attacked
using a powerful fire spell the poor little characters will happily do this
even if the monster eats fire or worse yet reflects it back.

This feels limited but it also leads to chain-reactions that make you shout
"What?!! stop doing that!" which should be a familiar feeling to most here.
Mid-battle re-programming is fortunately possible. I would like something
like a "unless" or "and" clause but as it is I suppose it's already quite
daring as a interface.

It looks like there are some hidden similar clauses at work. For example a
character charged with casting protective spells on his friends won't do so
if there is already such a spell on them.

Yes, indeed. Clearly we need access to a convention of Final Fantasy
players, preferably one of those where people dress up as their favourite
characters!

I do not fully understand your argument, I think I'm missing
something...  A novel is a list of characters in the same way that a
text based program is.  I don't see why this linearity leads to
ugliness.

Are pure functional programs immune from your criticism?  For example
Haskell programs are not sequences of instructions (leaving aside
monadic trickery) and so functions may be executed in any order,
concurrently across any number of processors.  They are however
represented in ASCII, with two dimensional structure (linefeeds and
whitespace have meaning).

Hey its me .. the quite one again :)

I love this shit and Ive always liked daves connection to games and 
gaming as a performance style medium.

So just to add a little to this thread...

http://www.thinkinggames.co.uk/content/?p=167
A post i wrote on my research blog about the gambits system in ff12
Loosely connected to
http://www.thinkinggames.co.uk/content/?p=165
http://www.thinkinggames.co.uk/content/?p=158
on using macro script programming tools like 'glider'
to create botting scripts for mmorpgs
I love this sort of programming intervention and the way they have to do 
stuff like pixel picking to check health levels etc.. ace
its been a recent hobby of mine to follow and identify botters.
Been doing quite a bit of research in the area etc..

and on a slight older but associated tip
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_Of_Babel_(computer_game)
was a programming game i loved as a kid.
and of course the obvious candidate
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crobots
But you are right in terms of there being few modern examples
TBH some of the processes created by players in current mmos
is often equivalent to programming. WoW has frequently clamped down on 
the penetration of its lua based scripting system to avoid exploits that 
could practically automate complex systems ingame.

Along a similar but more tenuous line is the idea of rts systems as drag 
n drop gui programming. Particularly the recent wave of tower defence 
style games are a little like some sort of dsp filtering system (see 
immortal defence?)

As you can tell, my work has been moving more into games and away from 
the livecoding things i used to do, but this list stil keeps throwing 
cool little infobits at me :)

Ok, there are several responses to this. I can't get to them all here.

=46or me a novel is not just a list of characters.=20
Just as a picture is something far more than a=20
mere string of pixels in an array. The internal=20
mechanics of a novel's representation inside of a=20
computer is merely an exploit, a hack, that=20
computer science has found, although a handy one=20
at that. But just because a novel can be=20
represented inside of a computer through an=20
array, and a picture can be represented inside of=20
a computer through an array, this does not mean=20
that novels and pictures are nothing more than=20
strung-together tokens. I think this is quite=20
obvious. They might be so in a computer, but that=20
is merely a problem of representation, and even=20
worse, a mere representation within the computer=20
architecture.

So if you'll follow me on this train of thought,=20
there is no real fundamental difference in=20
programming via characters inside of a char *=20
array, and pixels inside of an int * array. We=20
only have to look at The Game of Life, or=20
SimTunes, of some of Dave Griffiths examples=20
previously listed here, in order to see that you=20
can very well program with tokens of all sorts. I=20
created a video-mosiac-programming-language a few=20
years back to illustrate something along these=20
lines. There are many other examples. I think,=20
like others here, that games are probably the=20
wave of the future on the question of programming=20
and its representation.

To get back to my original observation: the=20
special thing about character-based programming=20
is that the trick is almost readable. I say=20
almost, because most people can't figure out what=20
the fuck is going on. For example, I'm writing a=20
lot of C++ right now, and in that language you=20
can write a lot of fascinating obfuscations like=20
this:

for(char*i=3D"Hello"; *i!=3D'\0'; ++i) std::cout << *i << std::endl;

I'm sorry to offend all the robots out there, but=20
that's totally unreadable unless you understand=20
the underlying architecture of the computer. You=20
have to understand memory addresses and pointers=20
and loops and streams, etc. This is not writing,=20
has nothing to do with literature, etc. This is=20
more like knitting. So my real question is: if we=20
are already kitting, why not just knit?

Which returns me to the question of beauty. I'm=20
sorry, but code is ugly. Knitting is beautiful,=20
coding is ugly. Sure, I absolutely love the above=20
C++ code, I find it -- gasp -- kind of lovely, at=20
least fascinating. But it's still very geeky and=20
bastardly, i.e. ugly in the etymological sense:=20
it's dreadful. I'm assuming that most of us here=20
can read/write several computer languages, and=20
therefore can see the structure, the machines,=20
behind this code. So suddenly it becomes=20
something else. But not because of the glyph. The=20
glyph is only a token, I want to say=20
"un-signe-quelconque" in hommage to Deleuze's=20
"instants-quelconques".

It can be rendered fascinating, lovely,=20
beautiful, whatever -- but you have to transform=20
it into a performance, re-render it into an=20
aesthetic form, etc. -- and play with the fact=20
that a computer glyph changes the use-value of=20
the more historical glyph. I suppose that's why I=20
love Livecoding as a sort of artistic manifesto.=20
The art-hack of livecoding is a very novel=20
response to the computer science hack of char *=20
arrays. It uses the constructs of art-performance=20
to redefine code itself, by revealing something=20
in the code that talks to artists, as if it were=20
always there in the code to begin with. It also=20
speaks to the history of glyphs. That's pretty=20
damn impressive in my book, but it still doesn't=20
hide the fact that text-based coding is merely a=20
hack and could replaced by all sorts of other=20
forms of representation.

All that said, I love to code and I love to look=20
at it. I think it's quite amazing. I'm also=20
fascinated with this historical hack of=20
associating the physical keyboard array with the=20
char * array with the programming stack. But I=20
cannot for the life of me see how people can keep=20
coding like this, i.e. from the perspective of=20
the history of human representations.

There is nothing moral in these arguments. I'm=20
not saying code is ugly in the sense that code is=20
"bad". I'm just saying that it's historically=20
curious, and in my opinion will transform into=20
something more historically profound. Hence=20
knitting, music, mosaics, who-knows...

>   I don't see why this linearity leads to
>ugliness.

Well, I don't know if that's what I was trying to=20
suggest. I just think that historically=20
text-based programming facilitated to an amazing=20
degree modularity and abstraction, thanks to all=20
of the modularity and abstraction already=20
inherent in text systems. Text is also linear, as=20
was the Turing Machine -- hence the alliance=20
between the two -- but both of them are far more=20
than that, too. So it's a mere alliance, like all=20
alliances, of convienence. But their achitectures=20
cannot be reduced to mere linearity. Computation=20
does not need text to survive. Let us not confuse=20
the two.

And so it seems quite revealing to me that the=20
text-computation pact would truly begin to show=20
its cracks at precisely the moment when we are=20
forced to work with multiple processors, threads,=20
etc. in order to evolve. The processor speed wall=20
has been good at revealing this problem.

I think it's also significant that many artists=20
use Max/PureData and all their cousins (vvvv,=20
EyesWeb, etc) without any trouble and do some=20
pretty amazing things with them. This leads us=20
back to the original Google talk.

I think it's an important question to ask, even=20
if we never get past it: was historically tying=20
linear text-string-of-perls the best way to=20
represent computation?

Yes, that's a very cool concept.

Haskell is still pretty unreadable, therefore a=20
bit of a kludge. But at least it looks unreadable=20
from the get-go and doesn't pretend otherwise.=20
But you have to be a computer scientist to read=20
it, whereas I'm going in the other direction.=20
Anyone can learn to play puzzles and knit, so I=20
think that's a far richer direction to explore.

I always wonder about Lisp. It seems to me to be a largely overlooked langua=
ge.

If you can program JavaScript you can program Lisp.  This is a good

What else is it then?  To me, on the surface, it is a list of
characters.  The paper and typography are minor details, setting the
scene for the list of characters.  The novel itself may non-linear and
multi dimensional, but is represented as a list of linear characters.

Of course the novel is far more than the component list of characters,
but on the surface level, that's all it is.  The same with a computer
program.  So what?

You've still lost me.  A computer program, and a novel can be
represented by a list of tokens.  They are more than that.  To me, that
means that the surface representation of something as a list of tokens
is not a limiting factor.

C is a particularly leaky abstraction, but this appears to be a straw
man argument, because C is an intentionally low level programming
language.

I enjoy knitting very much, when I get the time.  I attended an outdoor
"origins of programming" workshop in the summer where we sat and knitted
hats.  

But what is wrong with knitting with text as well?

C++ code is ugly.  Knitting with knotted barbed wire is ugly too,
particularly without gloves.  I don't see why knitting with symbols is
intrinsically ugly if knitting with wool is beautiful.

In functional programming we don't have arrays, we have lists, which are
quite a different kettle of fish.

What's unreadable about it?  I find its syntax remarkably clear and
concise.

I don't think of myself as a computer scientist, and I can read it.  As
Dave says, new programmers seem to find learning functional languages
(in his case Scheme) just as easy if not easier than imperative ones.
It's only imperative programmers who find it harder to learn a
functional language than another imperative one, because they're used to
languages being largely the same under the hood.

"Playing puzzles and knitting" seems a good description of programming, to me.

Gentlemen, let's not talk like this around here of all places - all
languages are created equally (except COBOL).

And who's overlooking lisp? There are two livecoding systems which use it
(given that scheme is a flavour of lisp).

Talking of 1D/2D and lisp:
http://www.32768.com/bill/weblog/2004/11/04/someone-threw-up-some-lisp/

I will buy a beer for the first person to come up with a language
expressed in 'knitware'.

First, it forces you to think about programming as a process of
binding a single argument at a time. I often think about expressions
as an ensemble of function calls, not one argument binding at a time.

Second, as one of the audience brought up at the end of the
presentation, there is no means of introspection of the history of the
composition and he only had a guess as to what a solution might look
like (replay a "movie" of the composition).

Kyma originally ran into the same two issues above and solved it by
implementing the graph view of objects, i.e. back to boxes and wires.
Kyma has a longer history and a track record of usage by a user
community driving features, which an experimental system like this one
lacks.

Third, I don't see how free variables are expressed in this paradigm,
which is an important feature of lambas in functional programming.
Perhaps I am just missing something.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_variables_and_bound_variables

However even given some limitations, having end user composable UI
functionality would be a big step forward.

It would be fun to see a game like DarkWorld[1] with very slow action. I
mean really slow - it's a game about colonising solar systems and battle
enemy fractions. Most of the time it takes a couple of hours to just
probe nearby planets, and _days_ to probe nearby solarsystems. 

Imagine a equally slow gameplay with programmable robots. Not so fun to
come home from work and see a pile of non-working harvest bots just
because you were refining their algorithm's while you were drunk the
night before, eh ? :-P

So, this program is more then just a sequence of characters.

C++ is a language, not just "language", it is unreadable unless you
learn it, and often knowledge of culture of C++ programming and its
ancestry helps to read more in it. this extra can only be understood
by human readers and is meaningless to computers.

This fragment unambigously communicates to computer to print

  Hello

It also communicates to the readers of this list that C++ may look scary.

It also contains at least two references to the programming culture:
output of "Hello" as variation of "Hello, world!" and using of "i" as
a loop counter.

Further it uses unconventional code layout to stress the point it
tries to communicate to us, humans.

It fails to communicate much to non-speakers just as unfamiliar
natural language would.

it is dreadful because you wanted to communicate dread - so it works

I say this because if you kept the paper and typography but swapped the

Ok, so is your argument that formal and natural languages are very
different, and that computer programming should not be as tied to formal
languages as it is?

I don't know.  My hunch is that an evolved ability for speech
(communication via a linear sequence of symbolic movements) has somehow
been appropriated.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think you'd agree
that while a program might look like scrabble, when you read it, it
evokes something very different and non-linear.

Yawn. Suggesting that I'm just arguing from the position of

Hi all,

Might be an appropriate time to throw this in the mix, it's the last in m=

series of gamepad livecoding languages - and it's about as non linear as =

Mine too, different example then: legal documents are pretty
unreadable to me even when written in a dialect of my mother tongue. I
might eventually understand them, but my brain hurts if I try.

The reason legalese is different from literary language is that it
wants to fullfill a different set of requirements - it has to
communicate in the least subjective and ambiguous manner. Doesn't mean
you can't use it to tell stories.

The same with code - its language is different from natural languages
because of different goal - but it is steal a means of communication
and hence can be hijacked by artists to tell stories or create
pictures in one's head.

Um, a few days ago I was trying to interface an LED matrix with
a parallel port. It struck me that LED's, resistors, capacitors,
and the very basic components are functions. And putting the
wires into the breadboard holes was a bizarre experience.....
it felt like knitting. Eeks! Knitting's for gurlz.

I'm trying to follow this, and I'm not sure I agree with your arguments -
but I do agree with the spirit of what you are saying.

I think at issue is not so much individual languages, but the philosophie=
s
they represent. I think it's fair to say that functional languages are th=
e
closest to mathematics - and it's also fair to blame mathematicians for a
lot of unreadability ;) but this unreadability and "un-naturalness" is fo=
r
a reason. I read this yesterday, which I think is appropriate:
http://www.vex.net/~trebla/weblog/common.html

I think this argument usually comes up, not because of aesthetic reasons,
but because there is a feeling that programming is hard, we are not very
good at it, and there must be ways of improving the situation.

Ironically, haskell is a language which tries very hard to make
programming easier and safer (by constraining what you can do).

programming languages are called that because they share *some*
properties with natural languages: they exist to create and
communicate meaning. they indeed would be uninteresting subjects to a
natural linguistics scholar, but that's why programming linguistics
exists.

languages don't exist to write literature, but are used by artists to
do that nevertheless. using natural language to tell stories that
never happened, to envoke emotions and sketch landscapes was a sort of
hackery - misusing tool that was used to communicate about reality -
but eventually these new uses transformed the language and the mind of
its users.

code doesn't exist to be beautiful, but often nevertheless is - like
landscapes or faces [*]. to appreciate it though you've got to
understand what it's doing and often - guess why it is written the way
it is. but i guess understanding alone is not enough for appreciation
- you've got to respect the medium to see beautiful code.

[*] from evolutionary point of view one of important goals of the face
is to be attractive. using beauty for art is another hack that artists
perform. beauty of code helps it survive (as obfuscated c code contest
shows - code that from enginering point of view shouldn't exist gets
archived and mirrored on http://www.ioccc.org/ due to its perceived
beauty) wether this beauty is artificial (intended) or natural.

Understanding and cultivating that what makes code beautiful is what
"text-based" coding artforms are about.

Quoting Dave Griffiths <dave@hiddenorg>:

There's the execution model and then there's the syntax.

Haskell has an excellent execution model with all sorts of functional =20
and type-based goodness. Likewise, Perl has brilliant regexps and IO =20
facilities. They then wrap this in syntax that looks like line noise.

JavaScript and Dylan are basically Lisps (at the execution model =20
level) with C and Algol syntax respectively. Lua looks like Dylan but =20
is hashtable based rather than using the CLOS object system. Python is =20
Perl for the fearful.

There is rarely any causal link between execution model and syntax or =20
representation. I'd be much happier with a PD or Max that used text =20
rather than 1984-era QuickDraw boxes, and I prefer Python to Perl =20
because of the syntax.

But...

A good heuristic is "change the notation".

With Lisp I started out with Dylan, which as I mentioned is an =20
Algol-syntax language (think Pascal or Lua if you don't know Algol). I =20
have moved slowly to Common Lisp, which has Lots of Irritating Silly =20
Parentheses. The Lisp syntax is both addictive for hacking in and a =20
useful thing for writing tools to work with code. So some syntaxes are =20
more useful for some things for others, oven if they represent the =20
same execution model behind the scenes.

This site is good for syntax comparisons (and sometimes execution =20
model comparisons):

I agree the array/scalar/hash context stuff can make Perl look ugly,
until you're familiar enough with it to be able to see through it.  And
the inbuilt regex (being largely a language of icons rather than words)
looks ugly from being so dense (the /x modifier helps).  

But what in the syntax of haskell do you find ugly?  To me, the syntax
is incredibly clean and well defined.

> There is rarely any causal link between execution model and syntax or

Yes good point.  I think to the trained eye, the aesthetics of language
syntax matter much less than that of the semantics.

I was reading a nice mailing list post by a lisp person (sorry can't
remember where) saying that they stopped 'seeing' the brackets after a
day or so of learning lisp, and that people who complain about brackets
in lisp should also complain about whitespace in all other languages.

Could it be that syntax is purely a matter of taste? I cringe when I hear
someone say "perl is ugly" or whatever - such a ridiculous thing to say,
why can't people say "I find perl to be ugly" instead. It's such a
masculine programmer chest beating thing to state an opinion like it's a
fact like that! :)

Personally I wouldn't choose Haskell, not because of it's syntax, but
because I'm done with static typing. I know that given time I'd grow to
work with the syntax if I had to.

(One of the things I like about PLT Scheme's IDE is that it has a drop
down list of loads of niche languages to switch between - it's like a
difficulty setting!)

Well, "they" did stop using the "abacus for everything" but there are
situations where the abacus will outperform computers and so it's still used
seriously, especially in (I believe) some banks in Asia. I'd like to know
how those are operated, if I understand it correctly the way the symbols
(beats in this case) are manipulated to input the question is also the way
the calculation itself is performed leading to a speed increase compared to
typing into a computer and reading back the answer?

I find that a rather interesting angle on the link between symbols and
operations on them but it may be entirely tangential to your debate?

Personally I like text well enough but I also have a small toy abacus I keep
next to my computers. It's surprising how often those come in handy. I think
Nescivi has one as well.

The abacus is a pretty efficient calculator. For a good 
preseentation/analysis of it all, try:

Karl Menninger, _Number Words and Number Symbols: A Cultural History of 
Numbers_, MIT Press, 1977

I also have some essays about doing math with Roman Numerals, which 
isn't as impossible as it seems. ;-)

I have not played that, although I've seen it, so maybe the idea was
lurking  in my head - it is very similar mechanism from the look of it.
The main difference being that I "snap" to the nearest flower in the
direction of the joystick when its pushed far enough away from the centre
position - so you don't need to use a button to jump.

Thanks! It's not a very good video, and the thing isn't really finished

He then goes on and talks about differences in what different
programming languages require you to specify about different aspects
of your code. Not sure how this exactly relates to what's been
discussed, but it seemed relevant.

Hi Mark-

It is well defined as lots of punctuation and precedence that you have 
to remember. :-)

I prefer chunkier, simpler syntaxes. Lisp is ideal for me because there 
is no precedence to remember, but I like Algol-syntax languages like Lua 
and Dylan as well for this reason (the chunkiness rather than the 
precedence).

For anyone who thinks that Lisp users are snobs I'd point out that I am 
arguing here that Lisp is easier for dumb users like me than Haskell. ;-)

A good code editor takes care of the parantheses, and the parantheses 
make it easy for a code editor to do so in ways that would be much 
harder with a less regular syntax.

Python is basically Lisp with whitespace rather than brackets. So yes if 
telling all the brackets apart is a problem, think how hard it must be 
to tell all the whitespace apart! ;-)

*Kung-Foo Bar: Unconventional Interfaces for LiveCoding
---------------------------- Jan 5-10, 2008---------------------------------
**          Moderated by Dave Griffiths and 1/f )))**

*This is an online discussion, hosted at the LiveCode/TopLap mailing
list. It will be made available as a clean PDF document to all the
subscribers of this list and archived. DG and 1/f will not interfere
so much as provide an impetus for discourse and analysis. Just a
little formality in your mails would help us provide a cleaner
document at the end.

*Prologue*
We propose that the human body is capable of a larger repertoire of
movement than is allowed by the ubiquitous keyboards and the
Engelbart mice. It is understood that the act of livecoding pushes the
limits of this outdated interface for holy communion with your
microprocessor. Some assembly is still required...

In a few scattered hackerooms around the world, dedicated folk
are busy rewiring gamepads, hacking their new Wii-motes, cellphones,
webcams, and pretty much anything that can capture sensory data
and send signals to a computer. This opens a whole new universe
of interaction and discovery, coding and performance. This is a case
for writing a subroutine using your mandolin, and a case for
coding a symphony using a board of mahjong.

Here we share the strangest ("unconventional" is the key) ideas that
may come to your mind. This is not meant to be a repository of the
latest research (viz, papers) and interface products (e.g, monome, Arduino)
and hacks, but a source of new ideas that are a fresh document unto
themselves. You are encouraged to question the deepest notions about
 'livecoding' and 'interfacing', while staying rooted in the environment
of live performance.

Without further ado, I invite co-mod Dave G to seed the conversation with
his
thoughts. I also request Kassen and Desoumal to delight us with
their perspectives on this field. I am pretty sure this conversation is
relevant to almost all livecoders, who also happen to be one of the
most cutting edge group of performers anywhere on the planet.

After reading all the responses, I feel like I=20

My qualification was merely a result of my=20

On the subject of knitting, I just noticed this. Maybe someone 
already mentioned it already?

http://www.we-make-money-not-art.com/archives/009872.php#comments

There are of course a million different things going on right now 
with knitting. Machine Projects did some workshops some time back, as 
have many others.

And yes, the Jacqard Loom was my original reference. I don't see much 
of what we do these days as all that different from Jacqard Looms. At 
least not mechanically. I suppose the level of abstraction is a 
little too specified, but even there...

...

On the subject of livecoding interfaces other than keyboards, my 
Rubik's Cube controller was originally designed for Livecoding. It 
quickly turned into a simple 6-track midi sequencer but that wasn't 
the original intention. I suppose I should make some more digestible 
demos of how that aspect worked...

As I start typing it looks like I'm getting the first round and since it's
not yet clear how large the party is I'll just bring a few glasses of
whatever comes to mind and see if there are any takers.

Once I got started properly abusing game devices for music and discovered
the joys of learning to play a instrument that's hot off the compiler as
quickly as one gets to grips with a new game (as opposed to -say- the
accordion which took a bit longer) I started to wonder how I could take thi=
s
further.

Now, I like "twitch" gaming, very fast and hectic games with more or less
simple mechanics where rapid responses ban most conscious thought beyond
simple tactics (Street Fighter, Bullet Hell type SHMUPS...). These tend to
come from Japanese arcades and typically get played on digital joysticks
with large buttons that sense the lightest tap yet can withstand a solid
blow (a good property for a instrument!).

So, next up was a combination of steal^h^h^h^h^h borrowing Dave's circular
menus and realizing a arcade stick has 8 corners and house loops have 8
counts.

Presto; muscle memory linked to the loop, in a circle no-less, much better
then this neck-strain-inducing left to right business.

Nice about this is that opposites on the circle are meaningful (count 1 and
5 are up and down, for example) which is nice for twich-gamers as that
equates to shaking the joystick. Intervals of time turn into angles, also
nice, and I'm far more used to bad repercussions if I don't find the "bomb"
button fast enough then I'm if I forget where the "close square bracket" ke=
y
is.

Perhaps just as interesting as how quickly my brain adjusted to the new
interface was how this new mapping of rhythm to space (or direction, if you
wish) started to intrude on my daily life. Looking at a group around a
circular table would make me analyze the groups "rhythm".

This may be "live programing" but it's not (yet...) livecoding but it does
place me in a position to come up with some guidelines I found to work.

*Spacial opposites or groupings like to be meaningful, the brain likes thes=
e
a lot.
*It's a good idea to take a (type of) controller you already used a lot.
*It's a good idea to borrow control schemes from games you played a lot.
*Top quality game controllers (in my case a Hori Real Arcade Pro modified
with "Sanwa" buttons) are about as expensive as low-budget music keyboards
and a lot more fun. They can take more violence as well and I think they
look better.
*Don't give a single button multiple functions unless this makes a lot of
sense, whatever you do; don't use a double assignment for loading stuff tha=
t
overwrites your current situation. I tried this, no need for anybody else t=
o
reproduce my findings as doing so is particularly unpleasant. On stage.
Multiple times.
*visual feedback is quite over-rated.
*Interface sonification for musical instruments is under-rated and a good
idea if done while taking the musical context into account. In case of
emergency you can always play the interface by itself ;=AC).

Potential good idea that may or may not work;
Games like 3d fighting games or those snowboard games tend to use button
combinations that depend on where one is in a chain of events to determine
what will happen. For example;
push up and A to jump, down and A in mid-jump to somersault, sideways and B
to spin while in the somersault (for lots of combo points unless you hit a
wall halfway through). Sideways and B while on the ground may instead resul=
t
in a quick turn or similar move. This is not that unlike function calls tha=
t
take a array location as a argument which may in turn depend on a variable,
etc.

Those games tend to stick to your muscle memory rather quickly. They also
tend to involve spectacular crashes if muscle-memory accidentally takes
precedence over looking at the context carefully.

Cheers!
Kas.

Definitely live coding has something that operates on two very 
different levels at a time, so really, the knitting drummer is really 
like a humorous comment on this:

Also Rosemary Trockel's work comes to mind, and also here the 
interface between code and bodily action is very readable:

That's interesting! With the Rubik's cube it's clear that not every sub-cube
can end up in any position but the same holds for those 4*4 sliding puzzles
with the one missing square.

Before plastic became cheap/popular/possible those used to consist of wooden
blocks in a wooden holder so one could cheat by removing all of the blocks
and re-arranging them. Somebody discovered that if you would swap two pieces
from a solved puzzle the result became unsolvable.

I googled this for convenience;
http://bd.thrijswijk.nl/15puzzle/15puzzen.htm

There are as many unsolvable states as there are solvable ones. We could
relate the unsolvable/impossible states to "incorrect programs".

What I'm aiming for, wouldn't it be fun to have something like Douglas's
Cube-system but aimed more at code then sequencing, yet with the possibility
to cheat included? Best (to my perverse mind) might be designing the system
to make cheating as tempting as possible. Cheating, unlike legal moves,
*could* lead to syntax errors which might propagate and eventually crash.

This would be quite hard to actually create but as a thought experiment it's
quite appealing and funny to me.

Yet funnier would be basing this on the Towers of Hanoi so one could use
that toy to solve a programming challenge instead of the other way 'round.

Yours,
Kas.

True, but since physical automatism or trained performance
of any kind is also key in forming what Kassen has called
'muscle memory' - which might be important here in terms of coding
the body as an instrument?

That's not my term, it's a well known phenomenon that's essential to
traditional musical performance, touch typing and playing fast computer
games (and a whole train of other things).

I used to think it wasn't possible to use this with a mouse but a while ago
I spoke with a high level player of competitive first person shooters and he
reported that he only had to look at a enemy, see where his mouse-cursor was
at that time, then get his "head shot" without having to pay further
concious attention.

On some level none, I agree.

I already side-stepped this a few times by trying to present my own little
system as "live programming" and pretend it's topical.

There's definitely a large overlap, for example in modular systems like a
Serge. I like livecoding, I like modulars and I like the 808, if I were
forced to draw this line I'd say the 808 isn't Turing complete (as far as I
know.....).

I tried to make this admittedly rather informal distinction in order to get
to the possibility of cheating to get more interesting expressions yet
introduce the chance of crashing.

It won't win any awards for excellence in non-ambiguous writing, I agree.

Yours,
Kas.

You know, sometime I don't remember things, perhaps because I'm not sure
whether I put them
in a memory or somewhere else. There was this Henri Bergson quote, which I'm

i should have said "coding (programming universal machines) and
sequencing (programming particular class of machines)

or "code or sequencer score".

my answer would be: sequencer is a particular case of programmable
machines and sequencer score is a particular class of code.

more knotware then knitware, but still. the inventor isn't around to
claim that beer though...

you'd have to think what problem knitware based programming would be
good at solving. probably something from topology.

@simon: won't knitware language be something for smart fabrics?

An incredible amount of work goes into designing gamepads - the
dualshock is such a good design, there is a reason it has changed so
little in years. I use a cheap dualshock ripoff one with too many
buttons (I try to only the 4 on the right hand side)

I think it's useful to begin with, but after a while it's not needed.

One thing I'd like to try is use the vibration - I haven't got a driver
that supports it yet (at least through oscjoy on linux) but it's
something I want to look at.=20

I once had to design the force feedback for a game - I picked different

This was the game btw, in case anyone out there has played the PS2
version ;)
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Thing_(video_game)

Nintendo are also the masters of all of this - they can make a game with
so little in the way of controls, and make it unbelievably fun and
expressive - the majority of DS games show this off very well.=20

I'd like to submit a challenge - indy games development competitions are
often run with certain restrictions, one of the more famous being the
one button game.=20

Is it possible to write code with one button only?=20

Just to add to this a little bit - I think I'm not completely off track
in saying that computer music is sometimes criticised for being too
cerebral. I think this can largely be blamed on the input method. None
of this is particularly new, I think Eno was saying this ten years ago,
"bring the muscles back to music" or something. Well maybe, ironically,
livecoding makes it possible to use a computer as a computer (rather
than a synthesiser in a different shaped box) and bring to a physical
level with a suitable language and hardware?

A lot of people tell me that al jazari looks fun because you could make
electronic music on it drunk. I think this is also incredibly important
somehow, but I haven't thought it through properly yet...

not all programming languages are turing machines. there really isn't a
definition of a programming language in this sense (as far as I know,
and I'm not a computer scientist, so correct me if I'm wrong)

I would say that is something to do with abstraction, but I've livecoded
lots of languages without that either (and you can have a turing machine
expressed without abstraction).

I got a little worried about this with daisy chain, because it shares so
little with programming (no memory, not even a linear program, erm
"shape") - there were some papers I read that said self modifying petri
nets were turing complete... but I don't really care now ;)

maybe it means that the music, visuals or smell come about as a side
effect of the process you are shaping. I remember first learning scheme
at school, it felt that the result of the program was almost a side
effect - it's like you design something intricate in it's own right
which happens to give you the answer to your question.

this is where interesting things happen, when you get things wrong, you
get the wrong answer in a beautiful way - "making art is all about
creating a situation where accidents can happen", (who said that?) and
there aren't to many places more accidents can happen that writing code
in front of lots of people on a projector!

There are no pictures of the program. Intentionally so, there is no
graphical interface beyond ChucK confirming it has found three HID devices
(my yoystick and two Beatmania toy turntables) and some remaining debug
messages. This is quite intentional, more on this below.

Extremely early in the design process it looked like this;
http://farm1.static.flickr.com/139/328980596_0ad19ccdd2.jpg?v=3D0

Later; less hair, more controllers, more beer;
http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1058/1234501402_e93ef54114.jpg?v=3D0

Finally this has so far resulted in this;
http://bottomfeeder.ca/top/vinger.3gp

(yet less hair, yet more controllers.)

Sadly this is a "difficult" movie format, one so difficult I haven't gotten
it to convert. RealPlayer for Linux plays it for me. It's also a very dark
recording made using a phone. you can't see my screen but then again; I'm
not looking at it either except to switch songs.

All of the music is 100% improvised.

Yeah, it's cool. I hope somebody hacks that tilt sensor in the new PS3 one

Yeah, I use small sounds; clicks and turntable scratch stabs and so on,
depending on the sound-set. If the current step lines up with the direction
of the joystick the sound triggers. Quantisation is for free here so my
"interface" goes into the main mix.

Yes, if done well. I didn't play yours but I'm quite taken with the Silent
Hill series, they get sound right as well.

Sometimes it's done badly, then I turn it off. I'd also like to see more
interaction between motion sensors and vibration, for example a scene where
the character is carrying a expensive vase or stack of plates, the joypad
might vibrate with the player having to steady it. This would make the
player a part of a loop in a very physical sense, this could also be
exciting for musical instrument design.

I don't know about code but I do -since a few weeks- have a one button game
design on the shelf that me and a friend would like to turn into a flash
game. Hope you understand I'd positively love to talk about it but will wai=

Some time ago I suggested that our "miniAudicle" ChucK editor could be
running a chuck program that would listen to the keyboard for brackets and
sonify them using one type of sound per bracket, opening brackets would
increase the pitch on a scale, close all brackets to return to the root (an=
d
never use backspace or delete to avoid mucking up the naive implementation)=
.
I didn't implement this yet.

Maybe the Fluxus editor could use this? There's certainly no shortage of
brackets and in my naive Fluxus experiments I certainly experienced that
soothing "return to the root note" calm once all of them were closed again!

He specialises in this.

This was one of my main design criteria; it has to be playable after a
6pack, in pitch dark while somebody is trying to talk to you. I found that
to be important criteria after playing some amount of live gigs but if you
still doubt I will be happy to buy you a few drinks in the name of science!

no, I think this is, in a sense what is at stake here. The abacus was 
of great influence to the introduction of the position thinking in 
hindu numerals to Europe, and of course to the introduction of the 
zero. My question was not rhethorical, and please forgive my usage of 
'they' meaning 'humans'. To rephrase my question: Literature may 
serve as a means to abstract from action, as to reason about action. 
Symbolic algebra has evolved as a system of reasoning about such 
reasoning, or action about action, and it has left the realm of 
calculation of results of this action. Would you say that live coding 
is about returning to the beautiful presence of calculating action 
and its results? For me it is about the impossibility of such a 
return.

I don't know about coding yet --- but in film editing (which is
something I do every once in a while), I would love to go back to an
interface which is closer to the actual act of cutting the film. Using
vision, it should be simple to simulate that, in'it?

A black surface... frames of the film projected like a running strip
on a black surface (inspired by AlgoMantra-1/f's paraboxx
interface)..... and camera capturing predefined gestures of pause, in,
out, play, ff.... and the output projected just above the timeline.

In fact, one could just project the whole Final Cut Pro interface on
the black surface... and track hand gestures.

This is possible because of a simple reason ---- the digital film
editing interface was *inspired* by the actual interface we always
worked on.

Programming was inherently an interface to the machine (which was in
turn was inherited from the typewriter, and the english language).

I still don't know how one can work with apis and code without
necessarily entering text in some form ... .even though we can take
the universal structures & symbols of common programming languages,
and attach that to interactive gestures... I still don't know how to
evade the task of typing when it comes to working with parts which
necessarily require writing a lot of text.

The most obvious muscle oriented input method I know of is kung-fu
with motion capture and gesture recognition. So essentially, instead of
the user's finger dancing on the keyboard, it is he or she who dances
to input commands/data/code.

I have been toying with some other ideas - like using the GPS
trace of a cellphone adrift  in a city. So in this case the walk of
a human being, his pattern of drifting becomes a way of slow
introspection and computing at the same time. In the case of the
Cellphabet project I used cell-tower ID tracing rather than GPS:

http://algomantra.blogspot.com/2007/07/cellphabet-10-how-i-can-walk-in-english.html

This can be used to produce music with a little ingenuity, and
lets say - 20 people walking the score.

I also think that the act of coding need not be so solitary and
confined. Perhaps an interface of the future would actually attempt
to intersperse the coding life with life outdoors - at the sidewalks!

...or allowing the movement of people in bars form an interface to
coding. That would be quite fun short project actually --- time lapse
shots of people walking through sidewalks, inside bars, or through
train stations... and using that as input to simple programming
structures... or to video editing, for instance. ;)

We just need to put antennas in people's heads (err... or just get
them to download a simple GPS app that sends us pings... use tower
switching or GPS... like cellphabet).

Sheesh, I still can't find it.  It was a far more beautiful way of saying
that
when we act according to a plan, we use very little of our past, the small
fragment that went into the planning process. When we act on instinct, we
use the entire past as if it's entirety had been squeezed into a single
fluid action.

I think there is a lot of important commentary in Bergson's three books
which
is relevant to interface design (also to robotics and AI):

http://web.archive.org/web/20051231115014/spartan.ac.brocku.ca/~lward/Bergson/Bergson_1910/Bergson_1910_01.html

EXTRACT:

If there is a phenomenon which seems to be presented immediately to
consciousness under the form of quantity or at least of magnitude it is
undoubtedly muscular effort. We picture to our minds a psychic force
imprisoned in the soul like the winds in the cave of Aeolus, and only
waiting for an opportunity to burst forth : our will is supposed to watch
over
------------------------------
 *Muscular effort seems at first sight to be quantitative*  (21) this force
and from time to time to open a passage for it, regulating the outflow by
the effect which it is desired to produce. If we consider the matter
carefully, we shall see that this somewhat crude conception of effort plays
a large part in our belief in intensive magnitudes. Muscular force, whose
sphere of action is space and which manifests itself in phenomena admitting
of measure, seems to us to have existed previous to its manifestations, but
in smaller volume, and, so to speak, in a compressed state : hence we do not
hesitate to reduce this volume more and more, and finally we believe that we
can understand how a purely psychic state, which does not occupy space, can
nevertheless possess magnitude. Science, too, tends to strengthen the
illusion of common sense with regard to this point. Bain, for example,
declares that " the sensibility accompanying muscular movement coincides
with the outgoing stream of nervous energy : " *[2]* it is thus just the
emission of nervous force which consciousness perceives. Wundt also speaks
of a. sensation, central in its origin, accompanying the voluntary
innervation of the muscles, and quotes the example of the paralytic " who
has a very distinct sensation of the force which he employs in the effort to
raise his leg, although it remains motionless."

No offence intended. I should explain that I'm Dutch and the Dutch tend to
use "we" in such contexts. "We" can mean all or most humans so I might write
"we are so cruel and short sighted" if I wanted to lament some perceived
aspect of human-nature. English and particularly US English doesn't

That's a good question. I'd like to hear more about how this affects your
practice and enjoyment of livecoding. I have to say though that for me so
far the calculations have been secondary to the communicative aspects. I
find that there are many musical structures that are fairly easy to express
in code yet are inconvenient to "explain" to the computer using a
traditional interface like a piano roll. I did find and enjoy that some
seemingly simple calculations resulted in pleasant patterns that would have
been hard to express in either piano rolls or normal language (for example
when instructing a fellow band member) but I'm not sure this is as aspect
of the return to the beautiful presence of the calculating action you are
talking about.

In general I think I find your question very interesting but so far too
abstract to give a concrete answer. It could be argued that livecoding is a
extremely abstract way of making music but personally and perhaps because of
this I like to keep it as practical as I can.


I realise explaining concepts like yours in immediate and practical terms
may be a big request to make but I'd very much appreciate a attempt.

Yours,

Hmm, I was hoping to avoid this conversation but now you've got my  
mind ticking :)  I'm not sure if I'm completely following you but I  
think what you're arguing is that Livecoding is - at least in a purist  
sense - about the direct connection between the program and the task  
domain.  That in some sense the machine becomes unnecessary and the  
common two relationships are removed (i.e. program->machine and  
machine->task domain are rendered unnecessary).  The dominant  
relationship therefore becomes program->task - with the implication of  
this being that any reification must take place cerebrally.

In a real-world sense we can think about this occurring when an  
experienced composer/conductor/performer reads and "hears" a musical  
score purely cerebrally.  This process completely skips the  
"machine" (i.e. the instruments and players) and moves directly from  
the symbol system to a mental reification of the abstractions defined  
by the score.  In short, the composer becomes able to fluently  
translate between the symbol system (the score) and the task domain  
(the sounds of the orchestra) thereby avoiding the machine (the  
players and instruments of the orchestra) altogether.

Just smack me around a little if I've gone way off track :)

A beautiful thought!

To pull things in the opposite direction, here's quite an arduous way of
programming that highlighting the machine step, coding with boxes and
lines, in ASCII.

You can define pd objects and connect them together.  Layout is
preserved as well.  Much like in ghostbusters, you can't cross the
lines, and there isn't syntax for different box types (messages and
numbers).  Fixing this would be short work, but I ran out of train
journey :)

Sadly you can't do live patching with it, but perhaps this could be a
starting point for thinking about more interesting ways of programming
with text.

That's interesting. I agree that one can read music like this, but  
would we
call it "listening"? So the question is about your word (in  
quotations) "hear"
here. These are two different ways of using the word "hear".

I'm reminded of Wittgenstein's passage on playing mental chess and
mental tennis. He seems to think both are possible, but for me the  
former
makes sense and not the latter.

If live-coding is about the relationship between the program and the  
task-
domain, it becomes a "formal art" like Chess. The sound is a  
"representation"
of the thought, just like the chessboard and pieces are merely a tool  
for
extended cognition (external representation) and not a necessary part of
the game.

As a musician are you happy with that conclusion?

Nice! I'm sure the guys on the pd-list would find this useful. You
should send it to them aswell ^^

It makes you wonder how a dataflow language would look with a text-only

Add a third person to be/describe the ball, and possibly a fourth to

Who said anything about ignoring or avoiding?  In my example the =20
machine was not ignored or avoided, it was deemed unnecessary.  Of =20

someone becoming so fluent that the machine could become superfluous.  =20=

Well, of course I agree with you that all tools have a huge influence =20=

on thought and computers are certainly tools. However, tools are also =20=

generally causal, and for these tools (causal ones) it is usually =20
their experiential results that effect our thought.  I would place =20
codes execution on a machine in this causal tool category.  =20
Mathematics, however, is a good example of a tool that is not causal - =20=

it's effect on our thought is reasoned not experiential.  When we get =20=

to program code things get more tricky.  Most programmers of course =20
balk at the notion of non-causal code (i.e. code that is never =20

Actually I was just trying to get to the bottom of Julians email, so  
frankly I blame him for this mess!

But while I'm here :)

Hearing is of course a physical phenomenon, so I'm not really trying  
to suggest that "inner hearing" is the same as "external hearing" but  
this is not to deny that it exists, that we make use of it, and,  
importantly for this conversation, that it can be pleasurable.  Just  
lie back on the couch, close your eyes, and transport yourself to a  
tropical island listening to gamelan :)

Well, I would agree that mental tennis is not real tennis but I  
wouldn't say that it doesn't make sense.  Bob sled drivers for example  
are well known for spending hours mentally visualizing their descents  
in preparation for the actual run.  But I'll stop being contrary and  
say that I agree with you in principle :)

Nope, not happy at all.  I want to hear it all with my external ears  
bleeding and my external chest thumping :)

Well no, I wouldn't make that statement, because=20

So if I understand you right, you wonder whether I would say that we 
could sidestep the automaton, machine, and see it only from the 
perspective of the relation between algorithm and action. This is in 
a way a question about the scope and media of live coding - at least 
it implies a decision there, which could be a in favour of a very 
wide area.

I was asking in a slightly different direction. I notice that the 
difference between interactive art or live electronic music and live 
coding becomes unclear, and so does the difference between machine 
control (steering) and programming (coding). I mainly ask, if we 
accept that live coding implies a broad field, in what way does it 
create a new situation in it? If it seems of no use to stick to the 
letter (ASCII), then we may, this is my suggestion, stick to its time 
structure.

But then, the time structure is essentially an involvement with the 
absence of direct control, not with immediacy.

I just wish to make a couple of comments, not in response to any
specific thought but to the larger flow of ideas which is happening
here. Very exciting discussion, I might add. Please forgive me if you
find my ideas somewhat ridiculous and outlandish, but that's the way
I like it.

1. ((machine))

Firstly, livecoding practice so far has mentioned computers
and machines synonymously, which is fine but the problem I
see is that 'machine' and 'computer' are two words that
encompass a world much larger than the microcosm inhabited
by personal computers, whether it be a Mac/Linux/Windows.
In this context I find the following text by my friend Wilfried
Hou Je Bek very provocative:

*" The sundial might be hardware, but the way meaningful information
 is derived from it, is the first instance of programming: If (shadow>line):
equinox.
The next step was the development of a formal language in which calculations
 based on data, accumulated after years of sundial observation, could be
extrapolated. The first program recreated and analysed the movement of
 the sun. The runtime of this program might well have been an animation
of the sun drawn in the sand. Abstraction of time had given to man the
power to simulate the future." *

http://socialfiction.org/sun.html

I would go so far as to say that ANY musical instrument is a kind of
computer, and leave the statement open to debate.

2. ((Interaction))

This notorious word has gained a lot of currency in the past few decades,
but to me it's usage remains somewhat bogus. For me interaction is basically
Newton's Third Law, which guarantees that every time you hit your head
upon a wall, you will feel a lot of hurt. Now over time you may feel that
hitting
a wall with your head may not be such a wise thing to do, and then what
remains
in adulthood is the subconscious definition of wall - 'not to be struck with
head'.
I think the physics of our world is interactive at every level, and
therefore
to say that interaction is a result of automative sensor-response
computations is
not very wise.

3. ((language/linguistic))

Surely the title of this thread should have been "non-textual programming",
since even visual flowcharts or coding systems are languages in the formal
sense?

word meanings are context sensitive.

in the context of machine-human interaction "interactive" implies
human on one side of the interaction. "interactive" systems are
distinguished from "automatic" by their requirement of human input
during operation. say:

cat cv | sed 's/foo/bar/g' > cv.tmp && mv cv.tmp cv

is automatic while

vi cv
:%s/foo/bar/g
:wq

is interactive.

and of course nothing is black and white and objective, you can say
that the following is even more interactive then the previous:

vi cv
jjjjlllll3xibar<ESC>jjjjllllllll3xabar<ESC>
...

(here user "manually" or "visually" searches for 3-letter combinations
that are replaced by 'bar')

no problem.

you can replace that with

type in "foo" in one entry
type in "bar" in the other
press "Replace All"

or
drag and drop Cv.txt onto TextEdit.app

Where does this difference become unclear? Or do you mean that we need to
work more on defining it? I think we do, and it's something I suppose I'm
exploring a bit.

I think of programming as the building of a new machine expressed within
another. The outer machine is a set of primitive rules. This seems to be
fairly distinct from steering to me, which implies the control of only
one, fixed machine.

i was trying to contrast interactive and non-interactive (automated).

the most interactive way to change all foo's to bar's would be to find
them in the text, delete and type new values in.

less interactive would be to ask editor to replace them and let it ask
you about each foo.

least interactive and most automated is to ask to replace all.

of course there is always interaction of something with something,
e.g. here program with text, but when they speak of interactivity in
the context of human-machine systems they mean interaction between
human and machine.

My point exactly, that interaction occurs at all levels of physicality,
not just human-machine "couplings". All that differs is probably the
"degree" of interaction.

That's just stating the obvious. If they are speaking in the context of
giraffes,
obviously they mean giraffes.

Clearly, I was trying to expand the definition of 'machine' in the context
of
livecoding, for instance -  there could be a way of livecoding an abacus to
play
a melody. Or a board of Go...

As you say this is the definition of interaction used in HCI, but I
think what came out of another discussion here is that perhaps this is
not 'true' interaction...  That is, action + reaction does not equal
interaction.  The two actors have to both be acting in order for it to
be interactive.  Maybe others understand this better and will clarify
the difference between action and reaction.

Some would say no program is interactive yet but I think for example a
chess playing program is interactive (unless it's not well written and
the algorithms it is following are obvious).

I think you were demonstrating the "line" between a program and a command as
well.

A similar example might be ordering "could I have this dish but with pears
instead of the apples?" or "please paint all of the red chairs blue".

In a way many (perhaps all?) comunications could be seen as small programs.
It strikes me that in day to day comuncation non-verbal coimunication
(making a cup of tea for somebody, kissing or striking them, bowing) could
be seen as a attempt to change their "state". It could still be argued that

meaning set by culture. I'm not sure I'm convinced "non-linguistic
programing" is possible at all, yet.

no, not degree, but character.

in less interactive system the non-human part enjoys large autonomy,
even though it only does what human asks it to do. but in this case
all human input happens up front, then the machine goes on to do its
thing "on its own". so when we speak about interactivity in
human-computer interaction context we really mean amount of constant
feedback from human part of the system.

this distinction makes sense because interactive and non-interactive
systems have different requirements and hence different designs.

my bad, when i was repeating myself here I forgot to add something

Character changes drastically with degree. A faint echo of some music
could be pleasant to the ear, but the same if played really loud could make
you deaf.

Feedback is constant in nature, in fact. If your keyboard didn't touch you
back when
you type, you'd probably use something else to input your command lines. The

other feedback you speak of is simply a representation of your own actions
upon
the machine. It's called GIGO.

>so when we speak about interactivity in
human-computer interaction context we really mean amount of constant
feedback from human part of the system.

I don't think constancy of feedback can be unilateral. Perhaps if you think
of this as a snake eating it's own tail you'd see where I'm coming from.

Yes, I meant this. As soon as e.g. the modification of a simulation 
of a physical mechanism becomes a possible medium of live coding, 
there is simply the question where it begins to become something else 
(please don't misunderstand, I don't want to say that there is no 
mixture, or even continuum, it is just working toward a clear 
characterization)

Agreed, recursivity would be a starting point for me, too. Now what 
about this: Assume you have a game where your first person movements 
depend on the environment, and you may change this environment with 
your actions. If you interpret this situation in terms of the 
environment as the machine in the machine, then you are building / 
modifying a new machine by your actions. But it is a standard 
situation for a game, so nothing special at all.

Then we have the choice: Live coding is something like a subjective 
decision to regard this action as such, or to find a more essential 
difference. One possibility is to characterize live coding by its 
distance from physical modeling, by its character of being involved 
with the formal, or axiomatic. So  I think Swami Fadereu is right if 
he refers to the sundial and to interaction as an example to pose the 
same question. I agree that abstraction is an essential 
characteristic here. But of course I am curious to see other views.

the other day i was walking with my son the "Art in Nature" route [1].

oh, great, the picture on [1] is exactly what i was gonna talk about,
i hope the image isn't randomized or something :)

when we were passing this tree the little guy was already tired (i
think it's the last work in the route), so when he saw it he said
something to the amount: "But this is not a 'real' tree" -- "Well, - i
said, - it's art, it's never 'real'". Which made me cringe the moment
i said it, but anyway, what I meant was - art is always a
representation.

Similarly, computer systems are representations of something. You can
make a computer to represent interactivity. You might say it isn't
'true' interactivity, but it still MEANS true interactivity. Circles
that we draw with computers aren't 'true' circles, but we do call them
circles.

I don't know how we will achieve this, but I have clarity on one point
regarding the 'semantic distance' between the code and the sounds
it is making. I would like that someone who is completely illiterate
should be able to decipher my code-actions and be able to relate
them to the sounds. So clearly, it is an issue of interfacing Perl or

I would say that case is not so interesting because the landscape only ha=

meaning for the player - i.e. it's not a machine in itself.

Where it gets harder is if there is an AI bot which interprets the
environment, now you are modifying something which is changing the
behaviour of a machine, a bit more interesting. A possible distinction is
that it doesn't _define_ the bot's behaviour (it's analogous to it's set
of parameters). If it did, this would be livecoding for me.

It seems that it's subjective what a programming language is, so it might
be hard to move further - but I think "total definition of something's
behaviour" points to something, maybe. The level of built in abstraction
makes this harder to pin down, and is a sort of continuum - in the same
way as livecoding from prewritten scripts or lots of predefined functions
seems to make the case weaker (to the point of a function called
"PlayMyLivecodingTrack();")

I think a definition of a machine for a machine to interpret must be
axiomatic (almost by erm, definition?).

I'm getting confused now, I need to read more about these sundials...

Yes, I agree. Te extend this;

If I were a band leader or some sort of conductor I might instruct my
pianist to play C3, then G4, then.... or I might instruct him to play a
arpeggio going up along a certain chord. These two instructions are on a
different level. A pianist who plays a rapid series of notes isn't actually
instructing his body to do this note by note, he has trained his muscle
memory, in a way he has, by practicing, re-programed himself. (it would be
interesting to wonder whether Thelonious Monk programed in a different
"language" then a concert pianist learning to play Liszt).

Livecoding makes this distinction in levels (more) explicit and in this
process makes the performer and -ideally- the audience aware that it's there
and *how* it works. This is unlike operations in more traditional DAW's as
there it's rarely clear if the chosen operation is exactly what's intended
or whether the composer/performer makes do with what's at hand.

One thing I have been wondering about this in this context is how
muscle-memory works both in favour and against us. It's harder to learn
highly unusual piano pieces and, worse yet, a playful shove towards a
trained martial artist could conceivably trigger his muscle memory and
result in a painfull unintended elbow to your face. I wonder how Livecoding
relates to this side of the "higher level" of instructions.

This may seem off topic in a debate on language but I'm not sure it is. I
think language too has the equivalent of involuntary "knee jerk" responses,
particularly where taboo subjects are involved ("the pil", and worse yet;
"doing it", talk about careless function overloading!).

Nicely said and I agree, but by kicking a ball against a wall you're
playing football with yourself and not with the wall.  A lot of
interactive art really just holds a mirror up to the viewer and doesn't
interact.  But perhaps I'm putting the human in too privileged a
position here.

Interesting example, I'd have it the other way round, with imagined pure
circles represented in the computer more accurate and so 'truer' than
those wonkily drawn with a pair of compasses.

1. Taking off from guitars, the popular cue-based interface called Guitar
Hero is notable. The score is in the memory, but the human
playing the game is being programmed to play it perfectly. In a sense, the
game is trying to teach you a visual language constructed by the
composer/conductor/band leader. All languages are in essence
'body-languages' since we use our body to speak/write in those languages -
computing languages are subsets of the human body language.

2. From "A Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction" by Walter
Benjamin: " *Even the most perfect reproduction of a work of art is lacking
in one element: its presence in time and space, its unique existence at the
place where it happens to be. This unique existence of the work of art
determined the history to which it was subject throughout the time of its
existence. This includes the changes which it may have suffered in physical
condition over the years as well as the various changes in its ownership.
The traces of the first can be revealed only by chemical or physical
analyses which it is impossible to perform on a reproduction; changes of
ownership are subject to a tradition which must be traced from the situation
of the original. The presence of the original is the prerequisite to the
concept of authenticity*." (
http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/ge/benjamin.htm)

3. Now looking at the current trends in remix culture and sampling, I have
come to the conclusion that the work of art should now be constructed as a
collection of loosely connected concepts, which can be 'played' by the
audience during the 'performance'. So the audience is the performer in this
case, and the actual programmer of the system a sort of god who smiles from
a distance in approval. It is a kind of evolution, where now the artist has
ascended one level of abstraction. From the capitalist relationship of the
stage-audience, we have now moved to the structure of lab-everyware.

4.  I like Dave's suggestion if incorporating some kind of AI system into

5. For constructing a musical language intended for play, one of the
important design statements I hold dear is of the 'ephemeral language', a
language to be used and then thrown away. So the language itself is
constructed while playing this livecoding game,
and when the performance ends, the language is discarded, or archived.
Because the construction of the language (and not statements) happens in
front of the audience, they feel a semantic intimacy to the process.

sure. electrical, magnetic, optical, temperatural, air flow etc effects.

to some of these effects we assign meanings, while others just are.

all these are parts of social reality. they exist because we believe
they exist and we agree on some details of their represenations and on
some of their properties.

nevertheless they don't exist "inside of computers", althouh in the
modern world computers form an important part of the substrat of
social reality - but it is exactly due to their ability to represent!

taking one of John Searl's favorite examples - money, a hundreed euro
bill is money because people agree it is money. Without this agreement
it has all the properties of the paper with an image on it, but you
need people using it to buy stuff for it to acquire properties of
money. And you can do that because the paper with signs on it can
represent 100 euro. The buying properties of the bill aren't "inside"
the bill - they exist in the social reality, "inside" society that
declares and agrees on its properties. The ability of us to use this
physical token to represent money sort of binds together physical and
social realities.

Now when we say this bank has this much money, but most of it isn't in
paper and coins but in computer, it isn't the money that's in

properties of some sum of money, something in computer represents
operations on money etc. The money itself doesn't have to physically

Very similar to social reality, the mathematical and logical
abstractions don't exist inside computers, but are represented in
them.

Remember: I was talking to a three year old.

If I want to teach him the law of gravity I'm putting it like this:
"If you're not careful on the stairs you may fall and hurt yourself".

If I want to teach him the essense of art I start with some falsehoods
that hold true in particular cases he's most familiar with and refine
it as he grows - just like in schools we first study Newton's view on
gravity and later einsteinian.

Dear Artem,

Very respectfully, I do not agree at all with you here. I have tried very
hard, my friend..:)

Computers are cultural artifacts too - the use of the English alphabet is
almost ubiquitous
in computing. It is hardwired and encoded, burned into the very heart of the
device.

On the other hand, India has 500+ recognised languages, out of which NASA
has a study on ancient Sanskrit - citing it as a promising computing
language for knowledge
representation in NLP.

Your statement only reflects the political plateau of the last 300 years,
not the centuries before
that, or the one we have just begun. This is not about Asian pride, but
having a global outlook. I would
live in Africa if I could afford the frikkin ticket.

Can you qualify that a little more? I'm intrigued, surely at the very =20=

not much more? As programmers we are more aware of this functionality =20=

APL? :)

But yeah, I agree. I love scripts.

In the early 90s we had Rapira interpreter in school - Russian based
dynamic typing langauge somewhat similar to pascal (except for dynamic
typing).

I wonder, what programming langauges does OLPC computer has on it? You
would think they'd want something easily localizable?

I agree that logic has no language, but any programmer on a computer would
think twice before coding in binary, or even assembly. Unless you are a
hardcore
microcontroller/FPGA level player of machines. Most popular programming
languages
require a minimal knowledge of English before you can begin operating any
computer. This is changing, but only at the level of User Interface.

There is a huge cultural wavefront in place that has also aided the spread
of
English along with technology across the world. But in the East, the notion
of
the 'word' changes drastically. Sanskrit is a language where entire
sentences
can be one word, constructed solely for the purpose of that expression.
String
concatenation has a tremendous meaning in Sanskrit culture. Chinese
and Japanese languages have a pictographic/hieroglyphic quality, more like a
PD
patch that a python script.

Yes, at the heart of programming we are merely manipulating symbols, but
their
relative placement in space is also very important.

That is exactly the political plateau of the last 300 years I have referred
to.
The Industrial Revolution, WW II etc.

I don't see how that disagrees with my statement.

I didn't say all of the social reality is now magically moved to
computer-based medium, I leave that to Matrix-conspiracy-theorists.

It's more like http://www.flickr.com/photos/artm/2185389392/ (I didn't
mean sizes to reflect anything, just don't have much space at the moment
to make show the picture in perspective. And I wanted Shiva to stay
"readable" :)

My email client that you see on a laptop screen could be showing Russian
or Arabic text, about Indian culture or African mythology. But i could
make Shiva mean Jesus Christ, now could I?

Neither voltage levels not magnetic properties of harddrives nor use of
binary code to represent numbers are culture specific (well, OK, binary
code could be traced to India I guess) and the fact that so much of them
are used to *REPRESENT* anglophone/western artefacts just reflects the
state of the world, but isn't innate to computers.

And I see what you argue, it's just that I don't agree that your
argument contradicts mine :)

My keyboard only has english("latin") letters on it and i don't have to
configure them because i prefer english versions of my OSes.

... but need to distract myself from this thread and reflect some ...

to be continued :)

I agree. Furthermore I think it works very well in this role. I've heard
people become as offended as they politely could and dismiss the whole
activity before even seeing or hearing it in person; surely the hallmark of
a great artistic statement if we are to judge by art's history!

It's a great thing that at the same time Livecoding is actually fun to do
and often enjoyable to hear and see but at times I wonder whether it will
-over time- rise above this context. The most enjoyable exhibition I saw in
the past year was on the work of kurt schwitters and his contemporaries and
friends so that meant DaDaism (as well as advertisement typography) in a
traditional museum, unthinkable at the time those works were made, probably.

Even more then this I wonder about the same process on a more personal
level. Will I myself, or somebody else, at some point lose a loved one and
like a guitarist or pianist might do sit down at his laptop and livecode a
sad song to deal with his feelings?

To me it's all language, from gamepad controlled icons to texts in English
handed to musicians and evidently it's communicating. We are communicating
things like "this too is performance", "this too is programing", "this too
is composing" with some luck "those nerds can swing too" but to a large
degree this is communicated the the usage of certain languages and not
entirely in those languages themselves.

On this art-history level the question "can I write about being sad in
ChucK?" may seem superfluous but I *personally* as a musician/composer find
it very interesting indeed. I realise that the piano is build to be a
versatile instrument and that if I wish to write a sad song at it the
expression will have to come from me and there is no burden on the piano to
facilitate that beyond having a keyboard that feels good and a well working
mechanism as well as some acoustical properties but does this become
different if the instrument is also at the same time a language?

I have no real answers yet and would like to stress I'm phrased this
somewhat sceptically but actually have high hopes in this direction. I just
wanted to share the question.

Yours,
Kas.

It is not. The "very heart of the device" sees only numbers.

The experience of computation is cultural but computation itself is =20

Sanskrit is a cultural aterfact and its continued use is in no small =20
part religious and political. This does not affect its formal =20

representation.

Cultural artefaction is a cultural artefact.

It's fashionable in scheme to use &#955; instead of lambda.

There are some Russian programming languages around:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapira

Some of the languages and machines developed for the Soviet space program
are also interesting, coming from a different cultural time and place to
most other technology, but there are very few details online.

It seems so clear to us that we can escape it, but it usually turns out
(with hindsight) that everything we produce contains our cultural leaning=
,
I wouldn't expect programming and the architecture of computing machines
is exempt from that bias either. RISC vs CISC and micro kernels vs
monolithic kernels? :)

I would expect the xxxxx people would have something to say about this.

cheers,

Lets discuss this a bit more. The "very heart of the computer" is the device
that makes boolean logic switching possible - the transistor. The transistor
does not see numbers - it sees only whether the base has a signal or not.
At the level of the transistor, there are no numbers, only a valve.

If computations exists outside of human (and therefore, cultural)
experience, it must be some kind of natural phenomenon? Is that
correct?

I am not very well acquainted with Turing Completeness, especially
of evolved (as opposed to constructed) languages. Perhaps
you might tell us more about this.

Non-computational languages have an analog component that computers lack. It
is possible
to derive identifiers, maybe, but how much of the language does that
encompass?

What isn't a cultural artefact, then? Sanskrit is actually just an example
I gave, could have been Aramaic. It is almost never spoken outside of
temples (by priests who don't understand it) in India and some Chinese
universities
where they teach and study it.

A quick google-search gave me this:

You could always ask at some retro gaming forum for help and newer ways

I've managed to do it.

I've also fiddled so that there is now an 'Email password' button on the
login page, however it will only work if you have an email associated
with your account.  Otherwise, you can email me with your login and I'll
sort it out.

always nice to see live coding.

off-ICMC is always curated from amongst the standard ICMC music submissions 
as far as I'm aware. So you just submit a proposal in the usual way.

I guess a counter-ICMC could also be run, but a few live code performances 
have appeared at previous ICMCs now, so there is a precedent of inclusion 
at least in off-ICMC, if not in the midday granular synthesis concert.

Hi all,

Just in case your in Melbourne next Friday (22nd of February) I will
be presenting a review of the work I've done on distributed
environments for computer music. More details below.

Cheers,

Rob.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

A Distributed Environment for Computer Music.
Friday the 22nd of February at 12:00 midday.
Theatre 3, Level 2, ICT Building 111 Barry Street, Carlton
	
ABSTRACT:

	Fifty years of computer music research has established a wide
	range of techniques and tools.  Implementing all of these
	within a single application is impractical, yet each task
	might require a different selection to be applied.  Therefor,
	the sharing of structured information between distinct
	applications becomes a key challenge for computer music as a
	field.  This challenge is further complicated by real-time and
	user-interface requirements.  In response, we propose a new
	distributed environment for computer music.
		
BIO:

	Robert Shelton is a final year PhD student in Department of
	Computer Science at the University of Melbourne.  His current
	research interests focus on problems in programming language
	implementation (lock-free concurrency control, incremental
	analysis), computer supported collaborative work (user
	interface, semantics, semiotics) and computer music with
	special attention given to existing computer music programming
	languages such as

		Chuck, http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu
		Imprompty, http://impromptu.moso.com.au
		cSound, http://csounds.com
		Nyquist, http://nyquist.sourceforge.net
		SuperCollider, http://supercollider.sourceforge.net

	Aspects of Robert's current research direction were
	demonstrated through a real-time programming competition at
	Loop Bar in 2006 ( http://esci.org/livecoda2006/ ).

A bot is somehow confirming a subscription in order to send spam to the

Sorry about this and for the delay, I've been away the last week.

Not sure about this. In 2005 we put out a separate call and took care to 
avoid almost everything which was amongst the standard music submissions.

They've restricted granular synthesis to one concert?! what are they 
thinking.

You could bring sub woofers and have a pub-based sub-bass concert..

I understand you are trying to bring elements of MC-ing show-downs into
Livecoding. It's a good idea, I think. It goes beyond the competition style
that has to remove the "nerdy" element... We're now only removed from
becoming as rich and famous as emenem by the wearing of our hoody over our
woollen hat or cap and some solemn nodding like "yeah, yeah, check it out"
was the most profound thing we ever heard.

I suppose we'll now have to have signs of audience approval.

Though you, Ge, nor my fellow audience-members can see this I put on my
hoody and nodded. It was a appreciative sort of nod, expressing my approval
of the initiated competition. I'm -through nodding- also trying to imply I
witnessed livecoding insult-competitions since I was 6 and am "down with
them". There is no sign of appreciation for cultural development here as
such things have no street-cred and really can't be expressed that well
through nodding.

However, it also doesn't quite go into "pretending to be a very heavy-set
man that can't nod any harder then he is already doing" territory, partiall=
y
because of the striking omission of feeding the randomly generated
insult-strings to the speech synth. Still, one shouldn't blow it all on the
first round so no harm done there.


Keep it real,
Kas.

I'm interested and mailing you on-list (you can send off list, open formats
strongly preferred if possible, thanks). I'm replying on list because I'm
particularly interested in your ideas on how to level the playing field when
different systems/languages are used which would also be interesting to a
broader audience.

To explain to our friends; in Marcel's competitions you can enter using any
systems you like (mostly MAX was used, I used ChucK, SC users were invited),
there are lotteries for who goes first (lottery takes place using random
generators made on the spot) and everybody gets 6 minutes per round. You
can't load external files so no samples and no libraries. No external
controllers aside from keyboard and mouse. I think that's all. Winner is
determined by audience appreciation.


This is great fun and a huge thrill, but not without issues. For example; I
made some  use there of the STK's physical modelling Ugens which are build
into ChucK, if a MAX user wanted to do the same he'd need to use PeRColate
(sp?) the MAX version of the STK which I believe to be a external that would
need to be imported. I'm sure better examples exist as well. All bets are
off for systems played by their designer or a knowledgeable user of a open
source system that could simply make anything he or she'd like a part of the
system itself ahead of time, eliminating the need for importing altogether.

IMHO, the true power of livecoding and what should be judged on isn't
spectacular end-results but the expressive power of the code itself. This
would perhaps create the need for a knowledgeable audience that can judge
such things but those might be hard to come by. In a current discussion on
the ChucK forum about the differences between ChucK and SC it's becoming
apparent that none of those involved know anybody who's fluent in both CK
and SC....

Yours,
Kas.

What expressive power are you talking about if the end-result doesn't  
matter?  Why produce music/visuals at all if you don't care what it  
looks/sounds like?  You might as well live code - a random number  
generator!

I didn't say that. I was talking especially about the situation of
competitive livecoding.

Say you code a beautiful set that lasts 5 minutes and record this. Next
month I might program this (degenerate case);

------------------------------
SndBuf buf => dac;
"andrew-set.wav" => buf.read;
5::minute => now;
//I'm off for a smoke.
//see you later
------------------------------

Exact same end-result (sound-wise) but not more interesting then just
opening VLC. Frankly I don't think typing that would be *my* performance,
it'd be yours and, this would yield no insights at all, etc.... yet the
resulting sound would be good.

What I meant was that "the performance" is more then the end result (or at
least the end result is more then just the generated sound or visuals), I
think it also involves a choice of what tool(s) to use and particularly
*how* you use them. As I see it Livecoding is about open-ness in this
process as well as the end results.

I talked about this because of Marcel's competitions which have rules about
loading files (so everything has to be written on the spot, (which I like as
a perspective) but those rules don't take into account that different
systems consider different things to be a part of the language itself nor
for open-source systems being changeable themselves, making the whole rule
moot, in a way.

I hope the clarifies what I meant. If it reassures you; I like end-results
as well and download and listen to nearly all audio recordings posted to the
list.

Yours,
Kas.

Yes, exactly, but it is important not to let the process become more  
important than the result.  Don't think I'm arguing for perfect  
performances here, I certainly don't mean to suggest that, but if you  
are going to have a programming competition then make it about  
programming.

I was also commenting on the competition idea.  Let me put it this  
way.  I love C code obfuscation competitions as much as the next  
hacker - but that is the point of the competition - to obfuscate C  
code.  What exactly is the point of an audio LiveCoding competition if  
not to produce the best possible sonic result.  If we can agree on  
that then why not use whatever you like - sound files, libraries  
whatever.  And then of course who's to judge the best music ... and it  
just goes downhill from here.  Of course you could run a "who can live  
code the best physical model oboe algorithm from scratch" but this is  
an engineering task, not a musical task.

Of course you do, why else would you be crazy enough to live code

Still, I would loudly applaud if somebody would live-code a oboe :=AC). I
think we'd all be in big trouble if we took livecoding competitions too
seriously. It's a nice format for demonstrating (sharing) tricks or showing
off, it's interesting to perform music in a different way and context and I
strongly suspect some of the audience members were in it because it looked
like a amusing parlour trick.

I don't think it makes sense as a serious way to compare skills in MAX v.s.
Fluxus v.s SC vs Forth vs ..... It's fun though.

The one thing I think we can say is that if two performers square off in
multiple rounds they will know amongst eachother who "won", regardless of
the audience. I think that's the underlying mechanism is MC-ing contests,
dueling guitar solos, etc. The audience will likely pick up on this.

That would be the way to go for serious competition if that was desired, I
think. Personally I'd rather play duets between wildly different systems as
that would force one to adapt to a largely unknown new context which is
where I think livecoding has the best chance to shine compared to other way=
s
of performing. I do think there's a lot of merit to Marcel's points on
competition (which I'm sure he will elaborate on in due time) but there are
downsides to competition as well.

That's what you get for ending your list with a non-obvious entry to
indicate it's open-ended nature.

The Toplap CD compilation "a prehistory of livecoding" starts off with a
(reconstructed) piece from '85 by Ron Kuivila in Forth.

My friend Rob Hordijk told me about working with Forth on a Apple around th=
e
same time, or slightly earlier, creating variations on Karplus Strong and
composing for those in a way I would call closely related to livecoding
except for the lack of a present audience.

I think another friend of mine named Jan Punter still likes and uses Forth
in a home-brew implementation for implementing customised embedded systems,
I'm not sure he ever worked with it musically but he might well have.

I would have email addresses for you (off-list) if you have a desire to get
in touch with fellow Forth enthusiasts.

Yours,
Kas.

I'm very interested in Forth use past and present, so if you're willing

I think end results matter, but with live coded performance the means of
production are part of the end results.  You can record some aspects of
a live performance but not the whole experience of being there.  The
furrowed look on the performers face is an important part of the
experience.

Also with live coding the generator (the code) and the 'end
results' (the output, e.g. the sound) are simply different
representations of the same thing (the music).

IMHO the audience is better off perceiving the music via the sound
rather than via the code though.

To me, this highlights a problem with the code.

One of the reasons I spent some time looking at forms of code which go
beyond the static ascii page is to make it more connected with the 'end
result'. I think it's important to find ways of presenting programming
which are clear and readable by a lay audience (I know I'm in the minorit=
y
with this view).

I now think that this objective makes livecoding better for the performer
too.

After Julian, I'm in favour of not requiring an audience for live
coding.  For me live-as-in-electricity is much more interesting than
live-as-in-stage.

Explaining live coding in terms of dynamic interpretation and timelines
(removing or hiding compile cycle so that programming is continuous) is
difficult, but is really the heart of the matter in my opinion.

Explaining live coding as "programming in front of an audience" is easy,
because all that dynamism is implicit in the relationship with the
audience.  But in my experience the end result is misunderstanding.

Ade, Dave and I met in a pub and livecoded together earlier this week.
There wasn't an audience, but we were still livecoding.

Perhaps a compromise is to describe live coding as technology that
allows programmers to play (e.g.) music together.  Of course solo live
coding is also perfectly possible but at least it shifts focus away from
a stage and towards the means of production.

I'd restate this problem as - how to define a language that is richly
expressive so it can be used to compose music, but does not need any
training to read.

I think you manage this in al-jazari etc by
a) use metaphor in the syntax of the language -- robots, daisy chains,
thought bubbles etc.  It's easy (and a joy) for a lay viewer to
understand registers, iteration, sequences, functions etc in these
terms.  It's not that the language is 'intuitive', it's that they take
advantage of knowledge and understanding we have already have.

b) using small alphabets, consisting of familiar icons, and not
combining them into words.  This makes the language simple and easy to
grasp.

And I agree this works very well, I think because it is so well done
that it can be appreciated as part of the music.

I think though that b) is a big deal, that there is a place for pure
textual live coding and probably always will be.

I think there are pros/cons.

Hi Kas and Andrew

You both bring up some very interesting points.

quoting Kas:
"I talked about this because of Marcel's competitions which have rules about
loading files (so everything has to be written on the spot, (which I like as
a perspective) but those rules don't take into account that different
systems consider different things to be a part of the language itself nor
for open-source systems being changeable themselves, making the whole rule
moot, in a way."

and quoting Andrew:
"Yes, exactly, but it is important not to let the process become more
important than the result.  Don't think I'm arguing for perfect performances
here, I certainly don't mean to suggest that, but if you are going to have a
programming competition then make it about programming. "

In the competitions that I organize I try to divert attention away from
these aspects. My primary focus is to bring live coding to a lay-audience.
The competitive element is there to create excitement, and the rules that
I've formulated are not intended to highlight programming skills but
thinking skills. I want an audience who understands nothing at all about
coding to at least understand that what is being projected is a
manifestation of a thought process. The idea is that the performer who
demonstrates superior thinking would "win". The audience votes for the
winner based on applause. And I would prefer that the audience voted on the
basis of what they experienced as a performance rather than asking them to
base their choice on something they don't understand (C, SC, CK or
whatever). A competition which would be about programming would require an
expert jury to decide the winner, and I am targeting a decidedly non-expert
audience as the jury.

I would like very much if we could go into the discussion further, but I
think it would be useful if the interested parties would read my article and
respond to what's written there:

Yes b) is a massive problem, especially in the light that I had to write =

Hi Marcel,

your work is very interesting and I wish I could attend one of your public=20

I spent the first ten minutes just coding a complex microtonal system based =

after 15 mins, when Ge had dropped out to recompile ChucK, I had to switch=20

within my live coding environment, and was live coding throughout, though=20

It was Ge who ran preprogrammed presets in the first half of the=20

Hi Marcel,

it seems that many of your claims would need to be verified or at

It seems that this is rather some kind of free market evangelist's

I think your paper covers a lot of very interesting ground but agree it
could use some tweaks. One thing that stood out to me is your explanation o=
f
how you arrived at the idea of using competition to engage the audience. Yo=
u
go from describing the Barcelona event (in a way I would agree with Nick is
exaggeratedly one-sided and perhaps too partial for a paper) to concluding
the issue with leaving audience members was a lack of understanding of the
code.

While this may have been a important factor and could indeed be a important
factor in all livecoding events we don't know this to be true. Many other
factors could have affected this, such as a breakup in the overall flow of
the performance as Ge recompiled ChucK.... etc.

I'm not saying you aren't right; I wasn't there but I do think this
conclusion merits more attention
 and care as it seems quite fundamental to the structure of your paper and
indeed to the whole question below it.

Your note on this Jazz drummer and his influence on other performers was
quite interesting but I think this supports the suggestion I made earlier
about duets at least as much as your own stance on competition so perhaps
including a note in that vein would be relevant.


Stylistically I'm not too sure about the relative emphasis on analogies and
examples like the snails. Those are interesting for sure but I might elect
to keep it more focussed myself. That would be up to you, of course. I
almost feel bad about criticising writing style here when the topic itself
could be partially be seen as a celebration of writing style... but you
asked for feedback.


You covered a lot more then this and I read it only once so far, I think
it's interesting enough to return to later if you'd like me to. It's a good
topic and I think you are making some strong points but it could use some
care.

I hope this was of some use to you, I intended this criticism as trying to
be helpful, not as competing. Apologies for that. ;=AC)

Yours,
Kas.

For me this gets to the crux of the matter (short quote from article)

"It is unrealistic to expect a completely uninformed audience to  
remain attentive for 30 minutes of live coding"

The massive caveat here for me would be - if the only thing of  
interest is the code itself.  In other words if the music/visuals are  
not compelling enough to stand alone then people with no interest in  
the code are obviously going to lose interest.  In fact I would  
strongly argue that even the people who do understand the code will  
quickly lose interest.

Of course in live coding the process matters, why else would we all  
bother to do it.  I would assume that on this list one wouldn't need  
to say so.  I think Alex may have been saying the same thing I'm about  
to.

> Ade, Dave and I met in a pub and livecoded together earlier this week.
> There wasn't an audience, but we were still livecoding.


Live coding doesn't have to be primarily about displaying the code, it  
is also a way of making sound/visuals, a new style of performance  
practice - with or without projecting code to an audience.  For me  
displaying the code is as much a credentials issue as a communications  
issue.  It's about letting the audience know that something is being  
created just for them - in the moment.  It can also be about making  
the code an explicit part of the work - visually as well as  
communicatively.  For those that do understand the code fantastic - we  
all love to discuss our work with colleagues but to engage in a  
performance practice that does not allow for engagement with non- 
experts seems misguided.  It's also worth pointing out that there are  
two kinds of colleagues for our work that do not necessarily overlap -  
musicians and programmers.  Maybe we tend to forget that musicians/ 
visual artists/designers need to be engaged as well as programmers.   
I'm certainly guilty of this!!  This is what I was trying to get at  
earlier - if live coding is only about engaging with programmers then  
maybe using music/visuals is just a cheap trick?

I should clarify that I don't think there is a correct answer here.   
Obviously there are many valid ways to livecode, but I do think it's  
important to think about who the intended audience is (and who it  
isn't) and why.

When I read this, I came to think of an article I read several years
ago about Japanese mobile phones, when text-messages was the New Thing.

Since the Japanese language contain so many signs, they can't fit them
all on a mobile-phone keyboard, so they had to cut them upp in
different patterns that appear throughout the signs. A dot in the
top-left corner, a horisontal line in the center, etc.

These patterns doesn't mean anything by them self, but if you combine
them like you combine clothings for a paper doll, you can create all
the complex Japanese signs.

Note, I read this a _very_ long time ago, and I don't think I can trust
the source so I might be very very wrong, but still, one could create a
graphical Forth-like language like this. (Dave: a betablocker for PacketForth? :-)

Hope I've made myself clear,

this sounds a little like learning hebrew. hebrew used in common use
(most newspapers, signs, tv, computers) doesn't have the dots and
dashes, as people know the (vocabulary) words so know how to pronounce
them. but when you're learning it, the dots and dashes give you the
rules on pronunciation of the words.

Hi Nick

thanks for the insight into what went on that night. I will have to dig up
that NIME paper because I am curious to read what more you have to say about
that performance.

Of course I based what I wrote in the paper on what I detected in the
audience in my vicinity. Maybe I was too far from the stage to get a good
feeling for how other people reacted, but the predominate feeling I got from
my position is as I describe in the paper. Of course every individual's
experience of a performance is coloured by their own predispositions and
values, so 2 people standing next to each other may have 2 subjectively
different experiences. (I did ask somebody at one point why they were
boo-ing so boisterously, and they said it was because you were loading in
fragments.)

But to be clear - my comments were not intended as a criticism of the
performance or the skills of the performers! One could hardly criticize the
two stars on stage. In the intro to the paper I'm simply trying to set the
context and background for what inspired me to concoct my particular flavour
of live coding. I am eternally grateful to both you and Ge for that
performance and for all the work you've done developing the live coding
concept.

Hi Julian

thanks for the note, I was a big unsure about including that line so I'm
going to have to defend it a bit better.

Folk psychology is no joke, it is in fact taken seriously by some
philosophers as a means of drawing relevant conclusions about an
individual's behaviour. (Daniel Dennett's comments about thermostats come to
mind). However the Churchlands have spent a great deal of energy trying to
discredit it, calling it "a stagnant and degenerating research program"

I did try to take a light tone in the paper as often as possible, so that
people wouldn't take things too seriously (but it seems some people did
anyway....). But the competitive performances are no joke - they really
happen and are a lot of fun!

Hi Marcel,<br> <br> it seems that many of your claims would need to be verified or at<br> least sources should be added. An example: &quot;Folk psychology tells us<br> that stress is healthy and necessary for an individual to prosper.&quot;<br>

 &gt;you are going to have a programming competition then make it about<br> &gt;programming. &quot;<br> &gt;<br> &gt;In the competitions that I organize I try to divert attention away<br> &gt;from these aspects. My primary focus is to bring live coding to a<br>
 &gt;lay-audience. The competitive element is there to create excitement,<br> &gt;and the rules that I&#39;ve formulated are not intended to highlight<br> &gt;programming skills but thinking skills. I want an audience who<br>
 &gt;understands nothing at all about coding to at least understand that<br> &gt;what is being projected is a manifestation of a thought process. The<br> &gt;idea is that the performer who demonstrates superior thinking would<br>
 &gt;&quot;win&quot;. The audience votes for the winner based on applause. And I<br> &gt;would prefer that the audience voted on the basis of what they<br> &gt;experienced as a performance rather than asking them to base their<br>
 &gt;choice on something they don&#39;t understand (C, SC, CK or whatever). A<br> &gt;competition which would be about programming would require an expert<br> &gt;jury to decide the winner, and I am targeting a decidedly non-expert<br>

going into the Barcelona event into too much detail is beyond the scope of
what I am trying to say in the paper. I could have written an entire paper
on only that (and in fact it looks like Nick has) and that's not my goal.
All I wanted to say is that it was that performance which inspired me to
develop a different angle on live coding performance practice. I'm afraid
that by opening my paper with a description of that event people are puttin=
g
too much weight on my observations, and therby thinking that I am boldly
criticizing the performance. That is not at all my intent! Obviously I am
going to have to try to tone down what I write so that my point comes acros=

these kinds of references are meant to keep the tone of the paper light,

kinds of things are always dangerous, I know, so I am grateful for the

I absolutely agree.  What I'm looking for are still more ways to add
elements to the live coding concept which will appeal to a wider audience.
People love watching football matches, why not try to appeal to that part of
the human psyche? It seems to be working with the audiences I've had so far.

stimulate my students to think about.

Hi Ross

Thanks for your feedback. Indeed I am noticing that my tone in the beginning
of the paper is not coming across to readers as I meant it to. I'm sad to
hear that it's causing dismay and disinterest because obviously that's not
at all what I want. As I said, I was insecure about making it public and
that was part of my insecurity. But the feedback I've received from the list
has been great and I'm glad people are taking interest in my thoughts.

And OT: I was mortified to see that I misspelled "cite" as "site" :-S So to
correct myself: please do not "cite" the paper or for that matter don't put
it on a "site" either.

I'm not really going for an optimal format here, just a different flavour.
And it would be a crying shame if my format became typical for live coding,
because it lacks so much of what is really cool about the whole live coding
concept! I am simply suggesting an alternative which has worked for me over
here in this tiny village of Utrecht.

thanks for reminding me of this - I had forgotten about that. That was
indeed something which the audience loved. But as the performance progressed
those comments became less frequent.
Another element which was unfortunate is that the people standing closer to

I don't think there is anything wrong with opening with that scene; I think
I do realise what you are trying to achieve which is to illustrate how you
originally arrived at the concept and what origin you started from in
developing your own contests. It might be preferable to place more emphasis
on this being your own experience which led to your own concept. There's
nothing wrong with starting from a hunch, then relating that back to
objective fact only later. You have plenty of opportunity for that because
you did book results. In a way this paper is about a personal search of
yours and I think I'd recommend placing more emphasis on that.

I think we all agree that it would benefit from some more work but I'd also
like to add that I think this is very worthwhile. Yours may well be the
first experiment with competitive livecoding on this scale so chronicling
how you arrived at it and what you found so far could benefit others.

The section linked to note [6], sorry, I can't easily copy-paste from the

I did laugh about those :=AC). Still, I don't think the link between your
writing and the examples is that clear yet. It could also be read as you
trying to actually use those snails as saying something about people. If
we'd take that line of reasoning seriously we may need a ban on salty food
(if I can exaggerate for a second).

Sorry, joke. I imagined the funny situation where I was so swayed by your
text I'd try to help you improve it by announcing I'd write a better paper
on this topic. :=ACp

Perhaps I should add, for my fellow list members who haven't had the chance
to attend, that I listened and played in your contests and that it does wor=
k
nicely. People do listen and watch and are indeed quite engaged ("you misse=
d
a semi-colon!"). It's only fair to mention that, if we only dwell on your
subjective experience of the Ge-Nick battle and your draft being -well- a
draft we wouldn't get the whole picture.


It *does* work nicely. While we're at it, the one real downside of your
format as I see it is that the pressure in combination with the short bouts
seems to encourage presenting pre-cooked ideas and "quick tricks". This may
have good aspects; part of the game could be considering how daring you are
willing to make it and still be sure you can pull it off under pressure (an=
d
not -say- panic then being unable to adapt to  small mistakes early on) but
I wonder if this might be cause for considering assignments or other
constraints that would be unknown in advance to force people into adapting
and improvising.


Yours,

I think a livecoding performance _is_ boring if people can't read the
code, or at least - if it's indistinguishable by the audience from a
normal laptop performance, it loses most of it's significance (for me).

It's even worse if the code is hard to read - obviously in cases like thi=
s
it is often due to circumstances, but it can give audiences a bad
impression. I feel that only making it vaguely readable can been seen as
saying "there is no point, as you lesser people wouldn't understand it
anyway". I think it's a very quick way of making people much less
interested in what you are doing.

So just restating what I always say I suppose, but making things clear is
key to increasing interest in livecoding imho.

cheers,

dave

Yes, exactly because folk psychology is such a well known term, it is 
a term that one cannot use as an authority (there is so much 
divergent accounts of it). It is a bit like saying 
"philosophers/scientists say that X" without mentioning whose theory 
it is. So I meant by "joke" not folk psychology, but the affirmative 
attitude toward such highly disputed concepts like competition, 
stress and a "prospering of individuality".

Yes, I think it may be good to at least acknowledge that taking such 
points of view you take a very strong and specific political (I would 
say: "right wing") attitude. I don't know if this is intended, or 
even necessary.

btw, thanks for sharing the paper!

perhaps, but the danger in taking that stance is that it might deter people

I use the snail example as evidence that competition in general can have a
positive effect on fitness and survivability of individual entities. Humans
are also part of nature and are prone to the same basic physical and
evolutionary forces, no? I'm not comparing humans to snails, but drawing a
parallel between competition as an evolutionary force in nature and in huma=
n
endeavors.

here I can fall back on the jazz paradigm: on a bad day even the best jazz
improvisor will fall back on licks he's played before. It's the pressure of
knowing that the audience will see through this charade that encourages him
not to do that too often. A sharp live coding audience should see through
that as well. And in my experience it's true that when the pressure's on yo=

fall back on things you know. But I'm not sure that's a bad thing; however
memorizing an exact sequence of coding and reproducing it verbatim onstage
would not be desirable (even though it could be a good exercise).

thanks for clarifying, I see what you mean now and you're absolutely right.
I will have to take another look at that bit and see how I might formulate

The right-wing political stance is totally unintended, although I see how it
could be interpreted that way (there's the reference to competitive
intelligence in the beginning as well). Something I need to think about.

I think this really depends.  If you don't think about things and end up
with a tiny font on a crappy projection then that is frustrating.  If
you obscure your code in an interesting way, such as by superimposing
multiple performers' screens, then that is funny.  To me this is the
best of both worlds -- the musician's movements are visible, but the
audience doesn't feel like they're expected to read or understand any of
the symbolic representations of whatever musical model the musician is
using.  So hopefully they will feel that something interesting is going
on, and be motivated to listen for it in the music.

I suppose my feeling is that livecoding is more than about music - and
this forces it into a music maker's shaped box, i.e. an instrumental
technique purely for generating audio. I see it more as some kind of
performance art of it's own right.

I feel less strongly about this - but the context of the performance is
really important. When performing to the 'in crowd', overprojecting is
funny, but I'd be much less happy doing this to people who are less
interested in computer performance for it's own right. Maybe I am wrong,
but I don't think deliberately obscured text captures peoples attention a=
s
much as something they can follow, even slightly.

I must make it clear that I'm talking about performance in terms of
broadening appeal - I'm not saying all livecoding should be about that.

I think this is the general case with music.  A big part of hearing a
skilled performer make music is watching them do so.  You even get
dancers on stage next to the musicians, who aren't even making any
sounds, only gestures...  They're still part of the musical performance
and so in a broad sense are making music...  So we agree I think but I
am using the term 'music' to include the performance as a whole, which
you describe as 'extra' to the music.

But aren't you saying that people don't need to look at livecoders, or
what they are doing - that they should "stand behind the audience"? Or
have I got the wrong end of the stick?

I'd like to get as much of this extra stuff as possible - for me it's eve=
n
more important than the audio. Livecoding needs more stage dancers too.

I am suggesting that livecoders (and computer musicians in general)
should either 

a) somehow show some mechanics behind what they are doing, so that the
audience can feel part of the performance, and open themselves up to the
music
b) arrange not to have a stage, so the audience doesn't focus on them
but instead on each other, or themselves (dancing with eyes shut)

I think a) works quite well with a seated audience, and b) works well
with a standing/dancing audience.  That is, a) is anti-social, and b) is
social.  Of course you can have something in between, like a pub where
some people are chatting, some people are watching the performance and
others are moving between.  And then you can have a livecoder making
music without an audience at all, or recording it and making it
available as mp3 downloads with no prescribed visual element at all...

Why is sitting in an audience and witnessing the mechanics of music  
creation anti-social?

Maybe you are challenging the 'authority' of the performer?

So with b) it doesn't matter if the audience don't realise that they're
being "livecoded at" - we can go back to playing mp3's and ableton live?
:) I'm not saying that it definitively does matter, just that it feels
like it should to me.

One thing I've noticed makes a big difference to more crowded social
situations is to keep it short - people are quite happy watching
projections of arcane stuff for 10 minutes or less, as long as things
develop quickly then end, so they can carry on conversations/buy more bee=
r
etc.

> And then you can have a livecoder making

I was particually thinking about live performance - but I wouldn't be abl=
e
to define the difference between recording or performace.

For these reasons I'm not sure of the value of recorded audio only
livecoding as an end result (despite having made some last week ;)

Recorded livecoding make more sense to me as code really.

We could if we wanted, but that would be boring.  Also I think making
music via interesting, rich means can reflect on the resulting music.

I don't think it matters if they do carry on conversations, eat or drink
during a performance.  As I understand it this is how 'classical' music
used to be enjoyed before commerce took over and invented the modern
concert hall with its superstar conductor etc.  Sitting face forward
completely still ignoring all those around you soaking in the perfect
sound performed by high geniuses is a entirely modern idea AFAIK.

Yep, we need audiophile lisp machines to play back revision control
repositories.

I should qualify this - I find it annoying if people are chatting around
me when I'm trying to focus on the music.  Concert halls should be
designed so people can move around to find the right social/anti-social
situation to fit their mood.

Yes, I understand and agree. I don't think it would need to be that way
though because there are some things we do know. You did, for example,
observe that the attention of some section of the audience waned some time
into the performance and then you speculated about the reason. You also kno=

and hunches (which I think should be presented for what they are as well)
you arrive at -what amounts to- a practical experiment. From that experimen=

more conclusions can be drawn, for example from factors that were
problematic in the Barcelona event and worked well in your events.

In my opinion (which may be criticized!) it's dangerous to mix fact and

hunches, do a few experiments and then evaluate the hunches and be up-front

with packed rooms of mostly lay-men paying close attention to livecoding,
you can point at musicians trying things they otherwise wouldn't have and
perhaps a incident or two where the pressure of the situations had negative
effects.

Perfectly fine results, me thinks.

I wouldn't draw doubt to those by so clearly mixing opinion and fact.

I would say though that the typical "call-response" nature of duets, both
composed and improvised, does tend to have a "bidding war" kind of
character. When you are playing at the same time you are (hopefully) adding
to each other, instead of the "zero sum" situation of making the other lose
in order for you to win. You seem to imply that no matter who wins or loses
in competition both win in the long term by striving to improve, which may
be true, but I would argue that improvised duets with some elements of
challenging each other have many of the same long-term benefits.

Yes, I know. I have no issue with that. My issue was with the snails being =
a
very specific way of illustrating a very general thing. This does lead to a
light-hearted feel but distracts from the overall plot.

To return to the political sub-plot of this topic; social co-operative
behaviour can be a extremely strong evolutionary force as well. Homo Sapien=
s
is really quite success-full as are the ants and bees (who are hyper-social
and stand a good chance of taking over if/when when blow ourselves up).

With sufficiently specific examples I could "prove" the opposite as well. I
might call Powerbooks Unplugged "hyper-social livecoding" and compared them
to naked mole-rats (the only truly hyper-social mamal, as far as I know).
That would be fun, particularly if we could insert pictures of the naked
mole-rat ;=AC).

It might even be interesting to wonder if users of products that compete in
the commercial market-place, like MAX does, relate to this matter
differently then users of open/free (collaboratively build) systems like SC
and CK, if we wanted to go that far (I don't but the thought is amusing).

I fully agree. Still, I would be quite interested in competing in a
environment designed to force one to adapt (or "fit" if you want to talk
Darwin), I'd also be interested in collaborating to design such a
environment.

This is rapidly turning overly general but if you go to a warehouse that's
been squatted for the night to enjoy some music with a 1/1 time signature it
can be the highest achievement of a expert DJ when people forget who is
performing and stop caring about where he is.

To get back to the topic; if it's a great achievement for a DJ to mix in a
in-audible way we can also wonder if livecoding isn't in some way aspiring
to reach a stage where "livecoding" as a word becomes as meaningless as
"guitar-music".

I did spend one or two pleasant nights enjoying the technique of very good
DJ's playing very mediocre dance music by looking at their fingers, enjoying
the same performance in a different way from the people on the dance-floor.

I don't think it need be either-or.

Yours,
Kas.

I like this - it would be brilliant to get to the point where people
recognise livecoded audio by how it sounds - i.e. it couldn't be made
any other way.

However, I still don't like performing without a projection - but this
is probably because I was painter first, coder second, musician third :)
I just wouldn't want to lose the element of showing people what you are
doing - it doesn't have to take the centre stage, or demand all
attention though.

Well this is something that made electronic music exciting at the

this is somewhat inaccurate, or at least misleading. I think it was Lizst
who turned the piano around so that the audience could see his hands. And it
was Wagner who turned off the lights and told the audience to shush so that
they could concentrate on the subtleties of the music. Both of which have
less to do with modernism or commerce and more to do with romanticism and
19th c. individualism, imho (although I'm sure strong arguments can be made
on both sides).

two robot programming games that are just one apt-get away from you... (bot=

Here are the descriptions:

"RealTimeBattle is a programming game in which robots controlled by programs
are fighting each other. The goal is to destroy the enemies, using the
radar to examine the environment and the cannon to shoot.

Robot programs can be written in any language, all communication
with the main program is done via stdout/stdin.

=2D----------

Before the game starts, each player writes an assembler-like
program which has to decide for itself later on, in order to win
the game.  The pieces on the chess-like field are robots, which
have the abilities to move, multiply, exchange program code etc.
The goal is to put the other players' robots out of action while
staying functional yourself.

RoboCom is not a military game! There is nothing like weapons: the
only way to influence another robot is to transfer program code.
And that makes it particularly interesting.  The programming
language is easy to learn, however it provides an amazingly wide
spectrum of different strategies, which are all successful in
another way.

Personally I think arc is a terrible idea and to *me* arc code its
totally unreadable.  I think the idea of that shorter code makes for
greater productivity may well be true, but there has to be sane
limits.  How many people these days actually type everything anyhow?
For instance I've been doing some experiments in common lisp lately
and even though we-have-the-massive-function-names syndrome, with my
editor (emacs) all it takes is the first few letters then a hit of the
alt+tab key.  The same goes for all of the Java IDE's I've seen,
tooltips/dropdown/code-completion etc.

Subject: [livecode] syntax free
From: alex <alex
Date: Thu, 06 Mar 2008 10:25:32 +0000



I've been pondering about what a syntax free language might look like.

Perhaps something like max/puredata.  These graph based languages still
have textual labels like other languages, but the syntax is done by
connecting the labels together with wires, to particular inlets and
outlets.

But how could you get the meaning across without the syntax of wires?  I
think by making distance meaningful, putting labels close together or
far apart would somehow describe their relationship.  Instead of a graph
of labels you would make clusters of labels with particular semantic
arrangements.

I suppose you could just end up re-implementing wires - instead of
explicitly connecting labels, you implicitly connect them, perhaps
nearest neighbours are connected together via compatible inlets /
outlets.  This could be an efficient way of making a graph.  But I'm
thinking beyond this, to a system where programs are described using
shape, where distance is meaningful...  For example if I move one
oscillator closer to another one they influence each other more and
begin to harmonise, or if I move a bang closer to a counter, the counter
resets on a bang more often.

Clearly I haven't thought this through, but does anyone have any more
ideas how this could work?

The languages at either end of the programming spectrum are pretty much
syntax free - assembler and lisp. Lisp just has lists, and assembler is
just instructions in order with jumps. Of course a lot of modern assemble=
r
is much more, but in essence it's like this.

Both have the reputation of being very difficult at first to understand,
but also they can exhibit almost zen like simplicity. Interestingly they
also both lack strong distinction between what is data and code - I think
that is important.

I'm really interested in this topic, and I can't help mentioning daisy
chain. That is a 'code flow' language, rather than data flow, so
instructions move around a structure and execute concurrently when they
collide with each other - modifying the underlying structure. It 'works',
but it's really hard to map such behavior onto something else - to
actually deal with input or output.

These sort of things are on the edge of what we understand as programming
languages, so I've sort of made up some rules that I go by, that such
things need to have an axiomatic instruction set of some sort, and need t=
o
self modify - I think that gives them enough complexity to almost qualify=
,
although I'm not sure what as exactly :)

cheers,

dave

Yes exactly!  This is what I had in mind, something where you can put
anything where you like, but distance relationships between those things
are the meaning.

I was aware of reactable and have even seen it but not realised what it

This relates to the idea of conceptual spaces in this fine book:
Conceptual Spaces: The Geometry of Thought by Peter G=C3=A4rdenfors

The surface of a reactable seems more like a conceptual space than to a
purely symbolic representation.

It's been a while since I was into language philosophy but I think that's
semantics. The syntax of MAX/PD is that you aren't allowed to connect a
output to a output.

As I see it most graphical systems for programing (at least the ones I know)
enforce syntax by simply not allowing you to do things that aren't according
to the syntax. Some even go as far as having all setting of values done
through buttons and knobs that have set ranges (so no GHz oscillators in
CD-quality audio).

Perhaps I'm missing a deeper layer of what you are hinting at but I think
they are dealing with the syntax for you, it's still there. This is often
very convenient and at times a bit like Orwell's "newspeak".

You seem to be hinting at the difference between a compiler complaining "I
have no idea what you are talking about" and a graphical system ignoring a
certain click or drag and thus expressing "I'm sure you didn't mean
something with that". Different for sure and a interesting difference but I
wouldn't go as far as to say the graphical systems have no syntax.

But how could you get the meaning across without the syntax of wires?  I

The only way out -to me- seems a system where everything that can be
expressed is meaningful. If we wanted to nit-pick (which I honestly don't!)
we'd have to say it comes down to a "system where everything that can be
expressed within the system is meaningful", and admit there is still syntax
there. If I take a Reactible, take three of the blocks put to the side and
start juggling with those that's clearly a expression that's outside of the
legal range of expressions to the Reactable.

Perhaps a "system without syntax" would have to be a system without bounds
or one that keeps growing?

I'd start by re-defining the question. I'd start by trying to focus on
what's really appealing here, being a system that doesn't limit impulsive
creativity by having us remember what we can and can't do yet offers a range
of things that can be expressed that's as large as possible given that.

By that I'm honestly not trying to spoil the good idea by nit-picking about
how it was expressed. I really like where you are going but I think the
focus on "syntax", if maintained, would lead to a dead end.


I'd also like to add that becoming consciously aware of the syntax of
graphical systems sounds very healthy to me. Often one hears musicians say
"with system X you can do anything" and is forced to realise those musicians
subconsciously limited what they thought was possible at all to the range of
things offered by that system. Back to Newspeak....(hey, that last sentence
wasn't syntactically a sentence, funny).

This was the point of betablocker - any sequence of it's 30 or so
instructions is legal and runnable.

It doesn't make the code easier to read or understand though - quite the
opposite :)

I think that the beauty of visual programming languages are that the
contraints are obvious in that they are visible. Obvious contraints make
for creative environments, because you don't need to second guess what is
going on behind the scenes - you don't even need to think about it.

I think the way starlogo deals with a pretty complex syntax is interestin=
g
in that it's obvious what can go where because they are shaped
differently:

At least that does save you the situation where you have to shout at the
parser "Yes, that *is* perfectly valid and you are wrong!".

:=AC)

But yes, you are right, I very much enjoyed the point you made about
assembler and LISP while I was typing. Syntax, while restricting, is also
convenient. I think what Alex is after is a syntax that has most of the
traditional benefits of convenience as well as doing away with being
consciously aware of the restrictions.

I have to say though that when my Nord Modular editor refuses to plug a
certain cable into a given socket that usually means I made a mistake. In
practice that speeds up the process of expressing what I want to express an=

doesn't strike me as being needlessly restrictive.... but the NM probably
leads to less "hey... that's cool too" moments then Betablocker.

I think I was misunderstood here.  I wasn't saying that max/puredata
don't have syntax, but the opposite.  I was saying that they _do_ have
syntax, but asking how could we replace that syntax of wires with a
semantics of space?

Yes, but as an aside I note that this is not perfect in PD.  You have to
name a delay, and a delay with that name can only exist once, and if you
copy and paste it you end up with a non syntactically correct graph, and
have to go and edit the tcl code to fix it.  Well in the version of PD I
have installed anyway.

Yes I agree, the syntax is there, but I'm wondering if you could get rid
of it and replace it with semantic distance relationships.  That is,
instead of expressing semantics within syntax, express semantics within
spatial dimensions.

Yes, there are still the tell-tale signs of symbolic logic shining
through.  But perhaps we could get away from this somehow.

Or one on a non-euclidean surface, perhaps where you could zoom in
infinitely.

Also a system that doesn't focus us on playing with names of things, but
with the meaning of things.

I'm enjoying this discussion a LOT, especially the new mystical(!) turn it
seems
to be taking - a turn away from syntax ("the laws") and towards an
artificial
physics of juxtaposition ("the distance between two symbols" etc.)

The oscillator example is noteworthy when we bring physics into this mix.

Not necessarily a a response to the spirit of the conversation here, 
but Max/MSP and Pure Data enforce a hierarchy of inlets, where the 
"action" of an object doesn't occur until something arrives at the 
leftmost outlet. Also, evaluation occurs on screen from left to right, 
so program behavior can change depending on the location of an object 
with respect to others. (This last bit is from memory, so I could be 
wholly or partially wrong. I think also PD has an even weirder scheme.)

Some might find this approach/visualization of Forth to be suggestive 
of Max and PD:

Very good. I'm happy we got that out of the way.

I think this "surface" if going to have to be non-euclidean in rather a lot
of dimensions. It looks to me like we will be "overloading space" rather
heavily. MAX already overloads the meaning of space; space is used as the
equivalent of comments in that a spacial ordering is (typically) used to
indicate the structure of the patch yet MAX also uses the left to right
ordering of modules to determine execution order. Those two may not line up.

One thing that bothers me in spatial ordering (and sorting records....) is
that if we have two points A and B that are close to each other and in some
sort of relationship and place a third point C so it's near to A it will
also be near to B... which may not be intended.

We can accept that (like we accept changing pitch or volume will also change
timbre in many instruments) or we can involve a extra dimension (say colour
or height or direction) or have a gesture that "curves space".

This is one aspect where I think the Reactable deals with the topic in a way
that's still a bit naive (though solving this will likely go at the expense
of intuitivity)

I have this solar system fetish that I need to get out of my way before I
can say something
more productive, but - if A and B are (hypothetically) fixed diametric
points of a circle, on the periphery
of which C is a moving point, the relationship of C with respect to A and B
changes in an
oscillatory manner. In such a case, computational time and not space is what
defines the
syntactic juxtaposition. In such a universe, it is impossible for C to be
near both A and B,
relatively, unless it is one of them.

This is one of the problems I see with tangible systems and the  
ReacTable
is a good example. You'll have a problem if you want two objects to  
do similar
things. There is not space in the environment for it!!! In the case  
of ReacTable
it's a lack of physical space (there is already a big cube occupying  
that space)
and in your idea of spatial semantics, it would be hard to represent  
the variety
of things that you want to represent.

for example this line:

Mix.fill(200, {arg i; SinOsc.ar(200+i, pi.rand, 200.reciprocal)})

Here we got a line creating 200 oscillators with very "close"  
frequencies.
How would you solve that in a spatial system if frequency was spatial?

I think this is possible for very simple things, but for complexity  
you need
good syntax.

but I just dropped into this discussion, I might be misunderstanding

Yes, I think there are a lot of problems with the idea of tangible
interfaces, it just seems to be a strange buzzword for interfaces of no
depth.  I don't think the reactable is tangible interface anyway,
certainly no more tangible than a screen, keyboard and mouse.

I guess you could use a space where one of the dimensions was 'chorus'?

Wait, are there actually people who feel the keyboard isn't a "tangible
interface"? I think it mainly becomes a strange buzzword (and I agree it
does) because it's applied as meaning "tangible where we aren't used to it
being tangible". So far car-manufacturers and martial-arts classes aren't
advertising tangible interfaces as new and exciting.

It seems hip right now to turn these things around, like the Reactable and
touch schreen on the Iphone. Perhaps most strikingly with "force-feedback"
in steering-wheel controllers so people can feel immersed in the car
games.... featuring cars that all have powered steering in real life.


Oh, well, some experimentation can't hurt, I think it means we are
collectively moving from "hey, look, it works!" to "how can we make it work
pleasantly?" which in many cases was about time, IMHO.


> I guess you could use a space where one of the dimensions was 'chorus'?


I think so.... but then can we also have a space where one of the dimensions
is "while-loop"? When I wrote that I meant it as a sort of joke but now it's
starting to sound like a actual good idea to me. "Parallel processing in
non-euclidean space", it somehow sounds like asking for trouble but I'd
really like to see this trouble!

The keyboard is *familiar*. It isn't tangible because we don't notice 
it. It's the socks under the shoes of our software. Defamiliarising it 
might be a useful strategy.

Back in the day*, we used to rip keyboards open and wire them up as 
cheap a2d converters. We got through more keyboards that way... But 
stickers and using something other than fingers would be good as well.

I really don't understand the reaction to Reactable. Projector/camera 
tables have been a regular feature in MA and gallery shows for over a 
decade.

I'm sure I'm missing what you mean here. I have two IBM keyboards here, side
by side, and I'm quite sure they are very tangible and very familiar and to
me those are good things and I don't want them to be de-familiarised at all.

If I had a Reactable at home I'd want to get very familiar with that as
well.

Could you re-phrase what you mean? I'm sure we don't disagree and are
instead talking about very different things.

In case you thought so; I wasn't saying it was new, nor do I think the
Iphone's interface is that shocking but those two are interfaces people talk
about a lot these days. I was observing trends more then innovations.

I don't have a big problem with the Reactable either, BTW. It looks very
appealing to me and it's probably extremely accessible to people who don't
feel like reading pages of technical introductory text yet would still enjoy
working with modular sound.

Perhaps the main thing that causes the enthusiasm for the Reactable and
Iphone is that mice aren't that good and have stayed the same while other
aspects of computer interfaces (the visual ones) have evolved. I don't think
that desire to that degree existed yet in the general population in the
early 90's.

Yours,
Kas.

I spend all day with a keyboard and I find I don't notice it due to its 
familiarity. Now that I'm typing this I'm aware of every keypress, the 
feel and the sound and the different timing and hand movements for every 
letter. But usually it just fades out and I'm coding or emailing or 
writing a review and I don't notice the keyboard's physicality.

Possibly I'm confusing noticeable physicality with tangibility. The 
keyboard, as you point out, is tangible. It's just people don't notice 
it. I'm not saying we need to jam spoons in between the keys unless it's 
useful to do so. One reason it might be useful to do so is to spread 
your awareness of the keyboard as tangible to people who don't notice it 
as such. But if you're happy with the familiarity of the keyboard then 
don't let me make things difficult. :-)

I see what you mean.

This is a time of consolidation for new media. It's a positive thing if 
alternative interfaces follow VR (for example) into the mainstream and 
actually succeed this time.

Yes, I understand, but in subconscious usage it still benefits from being
tangible. I mentioned I like IBM ones and I've come to depend on the
touch-feedback of pressing keys. If I press two keys at the same time, by
accident I'll feel (and hear) two clicks, the same with three. So; at that
point I know for sure how many times I have to hit "backspace" without
checking the exact text on the screen. Through practice I don't consciously
notice this any more yet it's a clear benefit (to me) of a physical keyboar=
d
over -say- a touch screen one. Another obvious one is the little bumps on
the home keys for touch typists.

The Reactable is a tangible interface that may or may not take advantage of
things like that to that degree (time will have to tell) and it's
predominantly (at the moment) a novel interface. I think and hope those are
separate things. This is why I reacted to your point; I feel the  keyboard
(well, some of them) is relatively successful as a tangible interface, when
I have to hunt for the little "X" in the top right of the window I feel the
mouse is less so.

Yes, I see, and if you are implying one of the strengths on the Reactable i=
s
having a fresh look at known module arrangements which could be stimulating
then I will agree with you.

Still, I also think that one of the marks of truly great interfaces for
every day usage is disappearing from concious thought. Here that annoying
syntax stuff that just has to complain about every little bracket and dot
while you are trying to compose a epic masterpiece would be a good thing to
get rid off even if there too "jamming spoons" might be stimulating for a
day or two.

Oh, yes, especially VR which has already had most of it's "oh, look at
that!" phase out of the way. ChucKing a oscillator into a filter by drawing
a cute little arrow can't really be as satisfactory as as actually hurling
it. By that time we may need to re-orient ourselves about the names of
programming languages. chucking, colliding (and now near-missing!) would

Syntax *is* what a language 'looks like'. A 'syntax free language'
would presumably look invisible (or perhaps random?) and yet still,
somehow, possess semantics and grammar. Some of the posts on this
thread appear (to me) to have confused syntax with grammar.

Yes it's a trendy buzz word so gets applied inappropriately.  I think it
is used to mean "domain specific hardware interface".  Perhaps a more
valid use would be to mean "simple interface for direct control over
perceptual quality dimensions".  But of course different people have
acquired different perceptual quality dimensions, and the universal ones
are already well served by musical instruments without any need for
computation.

Yep, I was just playing with a monome, a very nice thing.

Yes this is a key idea I think...  How can we arrange all the possible
actions of a system of computation within a couple of dimensions?  So
you could take two programs, and find another program halfway between
them?

It would be interesting to somehow run PCA[1] on a set of computer
programs and derive eigenprograms[2] to form a reduced dimensionality, an=
d
use them to generate new ones. What does your average program look like?
It might be possible with some genetic programming type shenanigans, but
it probably wouldn't work for various boring reasons ;)

That's a bit like taking Shakespeare and Jackson Pollock and trying

This sounds like a excellent plan to me. I would love to see somebody even
*try* to crossfade between those two, in fact I would love to read a paper
titled "why using non-euclidean parallel-processing failed to cross between
Pollock and Shakespeare".

Now that would be cool.

You could represent each as a conceptual frame then tween them using a 
semantic net system (Wordnet for example), and render the results.

Subject: [livecode] looking for a cooperation partner in India
Date: Fri, 07 Mar 2008 14:53:04 -0500


Hi,

I posted this on the sc-users list and on the linux audio list before, but it 
occurred to me, that I might actually have some luck on this list...


As part of a dance-interaction piece we are developing with a dance company in 
Bangalore, we are looking for someone who lives in India and who is 
interested in this kind of thing and possibly, if it all works out, tour with 
the company.

I will be in charge of developing the code, converting the interaction 
concepts into working code for the performance, so we are looking for someone 
who is willing to delve into SuperCollider [1] enough so that (s)he will be 
able to set up the system for the show, and run code during the show, and 
troubleshoot if necessary.
Development of the piece will be over the whole of this year, and then in the 
next years the piece will (hopefully) tour.

Any other experience with software (like max, pd, processing, etc) or hardware 
(electronics, sensor interfaces, wireless systems) comes in handy too.

We don't expect to find the SuperCollider-expert right away (though that would 
be great if we did), so if you are just starting with SuperCollider that's 
fine, you will learn along the way.

Please contact me off-list if you are interested and happen to live in India, 
to get details. If you think you might know someone or have good ideas for 
how to find someone, that would also be great.

sincerely,
Marije

By 'language' I mean human-computer interface, in particular a textual
(symbolic) one.  By "syntax" I mean the grammar of such a language, the
rules of play as separate from the meaning or semantics.

As I understand it, in his book "conceptual spaces" G=C3=A4rdenfors sees
meaning (semantics) being represented not within syntax but within a
geometric 'conceptual' space. =20

I can't really answer better than that, I don't have a grounding in
linguistics so can't really look on this stuff critically, and need to
read more before I understand it properly.  But I do like the idea of
meaning in terms of shape, for example the idea that metaphor is the
application of a shape from one domain to another.

Yeah, this English in which we communicate on this list is arranged in a
syntax that is a many-tiered array-like geometric space. Blank space
between words separates them, and words are shapes too,
and combinations of more fundamental shapes that form the alphabet.
We do not see it as a conceptual space because we have so much conditioning
built on top of that kernel of memory (sic). Words by themselves do not
have much meaning unless they exist in our own mental lexicon.

about Ampersand.TV: South London based Ampersand are a fivepiece that
use recycled and found objects to produce sonic sculptures from random
noise. Their setup features the inside of pianos, shell casings,
corrugated iron, scaffold and brass pipes. All sounds mesh together
creating multifaceted timbral music. For more information visit

about Openlab: OpenLab collective builds on what is now an increasingly
blurred line between artists and software developers. The broad
expansion of the Internet and the democratization of computers have left
audiences more than ever confronted with new, hybrid software conceived
by a blend of artists and programmers. As intellectual property is a
fiercely debated issue, some people cling on to their little bits of
territory, while others choose to share knowledge, art and collective
work. This event will be a platform for OpenLabs' digital artists,
musicians and programmers, to present their collaborative works.

Deptford.TV is a collaborative video project documenting South/East

Hi Alex,

It's good to see this, as I've written a piece for that publication which
is more of a critique of open source monomania and only mentions
livecoding in passing. It brings things up to date well, and clarifies a
lot of the finer points of live coding - like the screen projection issue=
.
A few thoughts:

I'm not really sure what you mean by live electricity, in that the
electricity flowing through a computer running ableton is just as live as
supercollider - but I guess I'm over-analysing a poetic point.

Also, the software industry has gone quite a long way past formal design,
the latest fashion is agile development: http://agilemanifesto.org/
Which has some interesting features from a livecoding POV.

cheers,

dave

Yes good point.  I meant working on electricity live...  Taking your

In the web and gaming parts of the industry for sure, I don't know about
the rest though, or whether agile programming has made it to computer
science degree courses.  I admit this part of the article is a bit
overblown in any case.  I'll think about maybe damping it down a bit.

The point is still valid - it's bad for creativity in some bits of code,
good in others. As you say, the reason is practical.

The most extreme opposite of livecoding I've heard of is at nasa:

achieved."

This is interesting. My company uses some (not all) elements of agile  
coding because it really does improve the quality and effectiveness of  
code first time round. Two coders collaborating on some functionality  
at the same time will always produce better results quicker, I'm  
convinced of it. As an analogy, a coder paired with a computer in  
realtime will always produce more interesting music. (I think...)

I also think that paired programming feels very similar to livecoding.  
I think this may be because you can see your code changing/working  
without your constant direct action, and yet you can still exert some  
control over it (ie. by grabbing the keyboard off your coding partner).

This is the first thing I thought when I heard about livecoding, the
feeling of 'thinking out loud' is very similar. Talking through an
explanation of your code to someone else while writing it definitely
results in better code. I find that doing it the full XP way with one
computer very demanding - but it does accelerate things tremendously.

I'd like to try doing full paired livecoding, but it seems that so few of
us share a language :) - the closest I've seen is powerbooks unplugged.

Good article.

One thing I feel deserves a mention (which I think I talked about before) is
the link between showing the code and the compiler/parser being freely
available. If there would be some imaginary language that would cost 10K$ to
license it would be unavailable to most of us (and the audience) and hence
harder to gain a understanding of. If I write ChucK on stage you could take
a photograph, go home, install ChucK and copy my code/music, likely gaining
a deeper understanding of it. FLOSS software is available to everybody
making it hard to use the tool itself as a layer of obscurity (as seen in
some electronic performances or even guitarists putting tape over the labels
on their pedals).

With FLOSS there is (more or less) a guarantee that the language being
"spoken" is available to the listener. To me this is a part of the gesture
of communicating by projecting the screen. We know that often not all
audience-members will understand all code but if it's important they can
read it I feel it's important that they could theoretically run it
themselves. To me this makes a performance in PD different from one in MAX,
at least on a conceptual level (which is not to say you can't expressively
perform live-patching in MAX because I do feel you can!).

I'm not saying there aren't limits to the availability of FLOSS because
there are. Somebody who only runs Windows would have a hard time installing
Fluxus, for example, but FLOSS goes to a considerably greater length in
making the language available to everybody and additionally would give a
particularly dedicated audience-member the chance to review the internal
nature of the language itself in order to understand what was "said" and
how.  Likely nobody would actually do this after a set but if we want to get
away from obscurity in performance it can be important that one *could*.

>From there on one might even argue that it's preferable to use tools written
in a language that's itself open and using a open compiler, even.

Oh, I like that sentence so much. As far as I know it came from here;
https://lists.cs.princeton.edu/pipermail/chuck-users/2008-January/002583.ht=
ml
(bottom of the mail)

I think would be all the better if it's a slogan that arose as a accidental
collaboration but maybe it was used to refer to musical coding in that way
before.

Either way it's great.

Odd, I went to the toplap slogan wiki page to add it, and found it's
already there, apparently added by me in January:
  http://toplap.org/index.php?title=ToplapSlogans&diff=2919&oldid=2892

I have no recollection of doing this, or of reading that post, or of
hearing of it as a slogan before.  I was rather low on sleep around that
time.

Yes, I asked you to. :=AC)

The thing is that I lost my password to the WiKi and somehow it doesn't kno=
w
my email to send me a new one. So, I asked on the list for a volunteer whil=
e
waiting for that WiKi issue to be fixed.

Maybe I shouldn't have written this or my last mail, maybe it would've been
better if the slogan was just "suddenly there" or coined by some
proto-livecoder in decades past. Oh, well, who cares.

It's an interesting point, and certainly worth looking into.  I think  
this touches on the language of performance, a subject which has a  
long and interesting history (but which I am definitely not qualified  
to discuss at length).   For example, I enjoy operas, but have no  
idea what people are saying most of the time.  Same for French hip  
hop, or Russian alt-rock, but that doesn't mean I can't appreciate  
it.  The language you code in is important, whether its FLOSS or not  
is a side point.   For example, It'd be interesting to see someone  
livecoding in a non-Western language like Mandarin, and possibly not  
much different than watching them code in a proprietary programming  
language that I had no access to.  Personally, I wouldn't mix FLOSS  
with livecoding discussions, because they feel like completely  
different subjects.  Would you discuss with Picasso how much he paid  
for his brush?  Or Da Vinci?  Doubtful, because its besides the point  
of their work.   From an anthropological or documentary or personal  
standpoint, however, I can understand, but I always wind up  
livecoding in MaxMSPJitter and it certainly didn't cost me $10K and  
it's widely available, so why not?

Alex: the concept of "sourcecode feedback" is fascinating... the  
computer commenting in the course code itself, as a conversation with  
the user?  tantalizing.  i can imagine the day when my Processing app  
adds itself as the author of a function in the javadoc, and leaves  
the comment "you really fucked this up, so i'm taking over; love, the  
machine"

Sure... and I'd add that from time to time I can't make out a word of
(US)English hip hop which doesn't prevent me from enjoying it at all.

Of course... but this is a article on speciffically FLOSS and Livecoding.
Code projection inherently makes it open (towards the audience) so I think
this makes sense as a topic and I think this line of thought fits that. If
there were a closed-source system that would suit my needs better I'd
switch, of course... and in fact I have at times briefly live-patched on a
Nord Modular without feeling the expressiveness got compromised by the
closed nature (though there the building blocks are more likely to be known
to the audience).

I wouldn't, no. I now regret talking about a fictional expensive compiler. I
picked that example because it's so simple and clear.  However, if I'd meet
Picasso and he would turn out to jealously guard what brushes he used I
would start wondering "where the art was". When meeting fellow artists I
very rarely ask about the price of anything (unless I want them to build me
something) but I will ask questions about their process and I talk quite
freely about my own in return. I always find it a bit of a shame if people
secretly hoard the equivalent of a brush, for one thing because it makes it
harder to determine the actual gestures made by the artist.

Please understand I was focussing here on one very specific aspect of
communication and from a highly specific angle. I have in the past gotten a
lot of enjoyment out of seeing people livecode in MAX/MSP (though not Jitter
so far) and if you read it back I hinted at that in my mail. I wasn't at all
criticising you or other MAX users, please do send a mail if you ever
perform in the West of the Netherlands. "Why not?" indeed! I don't think
there is the slightest conflict in our positions here.

If we'd really want to get into the details here we could compare the
documentation to MAX (which I heard is more clear then the one for PD) and
discuss how that could affect the "open-ness" of the performance. I don't
know either well enough to comment there.

I hope this makes it clear I was solely commenting on the accessibility of
the tool (and it's structure) in how it could affect the communication of
thought in performance. Admittedly this is quite abstract but then again so
are many of the issues around Livecoding and FLOSS so I send it anyway. No
offence was intended at all.

And in addition to this, a lot of code is "closed source" in the 
sense that practically no one ever looks at it (and no one wants to), 
because it works. I'd say livecoding is about reading code just as 
much as writing it. Also FLOSS challenges closed source approaches by 
assuming that one should be able to read code just as one should be 
able to read a book.

I also like the article!

Yes,  agreed.

When talking about Open Source and graphic art  we could also (to extend the
painting analogy further) talk about how in (relatively) recent years oil
paintings by the great masters have been X-rayed to (hopefully) look into
the development of the piece itself and how livecoding forces attention
towards this development instead of hiding it in favour of presentation of
the end-result.


I'm mentioning this because in oil-paintings it's now clear that the
audience *is* interested in the process. Considerable resources are spend
trying to determine how the great masters painted and what paint they used.
Indeed, one wouldn't ask Picasso how much his brush cost but evidently
people are very interested in what paint Van Gogh used and how he got it.

I'm starting to think there's so much to say about FLOSS and livecoding in
relation to other forms of art that instead of suggesting bits in addition
to this article there's space for a few more articles!

Hi Alex

Very informative article with some very good points. I do have some =20
observations however.

you write:
"No wonder then that we hear anecdotes of audience members feeling =20
alienated by laptop
performances where screens are hidden. They could close their eyes, =20
but couldn=92t they then have
stayed at home, listening to a recording?"

how is this different from going to an orchestra performance? I could =20=

also close my eyes and pretend I'm listening to a cd. The difference =20
has nothing to do with the laptop, but everything to do with =20
authenticity. Today, one goes to a live performance more for the =20
event than for the music. Kim Cascone has some interesting things to =20
say in that respect (see "Laptop Music =96 counterfeiting aura in the =20=

age of infinite reproduction", or "Grain, Sequence, System: Three =20
Levels of Reception in the Performance of Laptop Music"). An =20
orchestra performance is authentic because it is impossible that it's =20=

not. That cannot be said of a laptop performance.

you write:
"The practice of programming is informed by the corporate world of =20
business software, with its talk
of formal design, unit testing and ISO quality assurance. This all =20
attempts to drive the creativity
out of programming so that software may be as predictable as possible."

I find this to be an unnecessarily pessimistic statement. Only a tiny =20=

fraction of my students go on to write commercial software. The vast =20
majority write software to build musical instruments, create artistic =20=

installations, perform live electronic music, work with theater =20
performers, dancers, musicians, etc. etc. The 'corporate world' might =20=

inform computer science faculties of some universities, but in art =20
institutions where the craft of writing software is taught as a means =20=

of creative expression I personally don't see any significant =20
influence. Furthermore I think it would be difficult to prove that =20
the 'corporate world' is attempting to "drive the creativity out of =20
programming". =46rom what I know about Google I might infer that the =20
opposite happens.

In general, your article touches on a theme which is very important =20
to me - the use of technology as a means for personal, =20
individualistic expression. However any technology which has =20
developed beyond the limits of what is immediately understandable to =20
an individual brings with it problems of what can be considered =20
individualistic expression. To use the Picasso analogy: I could watch =20=

him smear paint across a canvas and immediately afterwards run out to =20=

the forest, find a branch, pluck some hair off the back of a squirrel =20=

to make a brush, and perhaps use my own blood to make a painting. Not =20=

so when seeing a live coder: I would be dependent upon the =20
generations of designers which put their intellects to the task of =20
developing a machine which I might never in my lifetime fully =20
understand. Because after all, living coding is ultimately the =20
control of a machine which is the product of another human's =20
creativity. I don't say this as a criticism of technology-driven art, =20=

but as an observation, and I am constantly asking myself how I should =20=

feel about its implications. As you quote Cage saying: "We=92re getting =20=

music made by man himself: not just one man." What then can I create =20
which I can truly call my own?

Thanks for sharing your article.

Marcel

You may close your eyes in an orchestral performance but if something
unusual happens which piques your curiosity, you may open them again.

I don't think it is much to do with feeling you are being made a fool of
or lied to, if that's what you mean.  I think it's more that you don't
know what is going on.  Something is happening to make this sound, but
you can't see what it is.

This would be fine if it wasn't for the peculiar arrangement of chairs
and social conventions that lead to you facing the back of someone's
laptop, wondering what you're doing there.  I have no problem with
people hiding their screens if I'm not somehow expected to watch them
doing so.

When has that ever not been so?

s =20

I disagree, but perhaps I don't understand what you mean by 'authentic'.
To me an orchestral performance is about as artificial a musical
situation as you can get, although this need not affect your ability to
enjoy it.

>  That cannot be said of a laptop performance.

Even if the screen is shown?

Perhaps my request for evidence of human movement and your request for
authenticity aren't so different, in any case.

Yes I admit this section is overblown and perhaps a little outdated.  I
decided to leave it in, because there is plenty of truth in it.  Despite
the readiness of counter-examples this side of the software industry
does exist, lures many talented young programmers in with highly paid
jobs, and has a heavy bearing on computer science in many universities
(certainly on the course I went through).  I certainly didn't have
students like yours in mind!

I guess I am to some extent projecting my experiences on to the world in
this section, Paul Graham style.  I went through a rather vocational
undergraduate computing degree  (although I didn't attend very much),
then got a job in the banking industry for a short while afterwards.
Maybe I just made the wrong choices and things are very different now
anyway.

Ah well, too late, the article is in now.

It may be worth pointing out that Marcel teaches programming (mainly in
MAX/MSP, I believe) at a school that's dedicated to music and media, not
music at a school dedicated to computer science.

I do think that what you (Alex) are pointing out is a very real phenomenon
and that despite all our great toys and the work of teachers like Marcel th=

perspective on programming that society at large has is still close to the
one you outline and I do think this affects our tools. For example ChucK is
heavily influenced by C/C++ which in turn is heavily influenced by this
corporate structure (fortunately there are plenty of other influences quite
contrary to this!).

When explaining what I do (in this context) I've run into fellow artists wh=

I don't think this is bad. C and languages like Smaltalk, Perl and Scheme

i always considered the collaborative live-coding performances we did - 
where several people would modify the same piece of software (in our 
case: a Pd-patch) simultaneously - to be a sort of "pair programming" 
(even though our "pairs" consisted of 4 or so people), which is 
certainly a technique found in agile programming / XP.

in it (but then: probably the book has enough FLOSS anyhow...)

ah, but it's a matter of trust that the something that happened is a  
result of some kind of effort on the part of the performer. So yes,  
it's about the potential that you're being lied to and that there's  
simply no way to tell for sure. Not that I think that laptop  
performers do this intentionally, but simply the fact that the  
potential for deceit is there I feel is problematic for laptop  
performance (Cascone describes this much more elegantly than I ever  
could).

that's definitely one of the essential aspects of the problem. Many

when recorded music was not widely available. I'm not denying that

what I mean is that an orchestra could never get away with  
airbanding, while a laptop performer could (and I know of many laptop  
events that have been faked because of last-minute technical  
problems!). Back in 1984 or 85 I saw Heart perform live and half the  
show was airband. I am convinced that 99% of the audience didn't know  
and didn't care. But I was about as furious as a pimply teenager  
could be.

now we're on to something interesting. I absolutely agree, however  
showing the screen is not necessarily a guarantee of authenticity,  
nor that the audience will understand what's going on. Which is why  
there have been interesting discussions about what exactly should be  
shown on the screen.

>

I think there surely is a relationship between the two, that one can  
reinforce the other. Although with live coding I prefer to emphasize  
the act of cerebral effort than human movement.

the whole idea of hijacking the developments which arise from  
corporate culture is the essence of hacking, no? Probably an  
oversimplification, obviously.

But without the ugly consumerism which brought rise to the Apple Mac  
I might never have discovered MaxMSP and might never have found an  
outlet for creativity. I hate the idea of being a slave to the  
consumerist machine, but my awareness of its existence surely helps  
me gain perspective on my craft.

I heard a lecture by one of the SETI scientists a while ago, who  
lauded the consumerist approach to technology because it meant that  
the price of doing interesting science becomes cheaper. I believe she  
was talking about a certain piece of hardware which not that long ago  
was only available to a handful of scientists, but since then has  
been applied to some kind of commercial product which meant that they  
could now buy hundreds of them for what only a few years ago they  
could only buy a handful with.

sorry for the vague ramblings...

That's great!

In regard to oil painting, I find impasto significant, in that the stroke=

and movement of the artist are captured and form an important part of the
'end result'.

I still disagree -- if I can't see a performance the question of whether
'it' could be authentic or not simply can't be asked, as I can't see
what 'it' is, or what it is supposed to be.

I agree though that it's good to know that you are getting what you
demand from your performers.  But I find that for a performance to
really grab my attention and take me somewhere interesting I have to be
led into it by seeing some human movement making the music.

Take Andrew Sorensen's "study in keith" (or any of his other videos).  I
trust him not to 'cheat', but the music is a whole lot more exciting and
engaging when I can see him typing in the code...  And I really don't
know lisp, so all I am enjoying is seeing the rhythm of his typing and
the growth of the code.

I think almost the opposite -- that recordings have led us to believe
that music somehow exists outside of a cultural event.  Music events are
complex social rituals of which sound making is only a part.  Remember a
music event you really enjoyed.  How many aspects of this event were
transmitted to you via sound pressure waves?  If you took away all the
others, would have have enjoyed it at all?

But cerebral effort is human movement in conceptual space, and the point
of live coding is to codify that.  My point is that projections allow
this encoded human movement to be glimpsed by others, or at least the
moulding of its representation.

Action painting (Pollock) turns the painting into a fairly direct

I'd recommend reading "Grain, Sequence, System": Three Levels of  
Reception in the Performance of Laptop Music
published at http://www.hz-journal.org/n4/cascone.html

an interesting passage:
"Music performed on a laptop is lacking in one element: its unique  
existence at the place where it happened to be created. Laptop music  
adopts the quality of having been broadcast from an absent space-time  
rather than a displaced one. In other words, a score most likely does  
not exist and the sounds themselves are unable to reveal a  
recognizable source. The laptop musician broadcasts sounds from a  
virtual non-place; the performance feigns the effect of presence and  
authenticity where none really exists. The cultural artifact produced  
by the laptop musician is then misread as "counterfeit," leaving the  
audience unable to attach value to the experience."

very interesting arguments. In my experience this varies widely. I  
can think of several performances of Early Music that I've seen  
during which absolutely nothing mattered but the sublime performance  
of the music. And the deep sense of gratification came from knowing  
that I could never have that exact experience again, unlike the  
ability to click 'repeat' on my cd player. Those kinds of experiences  
are rare, I agree, but that is not to say that they are impossible.  
But maybe pursuing this further would be a little like begging the  
question.

As a performer inevitably you take on another role than the one you have in 
everyday life, which is a form of deceit.

In performance the performer always tries to lead the audience away from the 
everyday world into the world of the performer, thus in a way misleading the 
audience member, hence deceiving...
A good performance is usually marked by the fact that it seems to take almost 
no effort on the part of the performer, rather than the lot, that it actually 
takes to make it seem it doesn't.

A good example is one of the rules of improvisation: "if you make a mistake, 
make it twice", thus deceiving the audience that the "mistake" was actually 
intentional.

And it is exactly this aspect of performance, which may have led the many 
laptop artists [1] to fake a performance due to technical problems, since 
they did not want to break the spell of showtime and break the expectance of 
the audience to be led into another world, to be deceived.


sincerely,
Marije


[1] As a side note: at least some of the livecoders on this list, started 
doing so, since they found themselves too often in the situation where they 
did not have enough time to finish creating a piece before the performance, 
so they decided to make that the performance itself.

I respectfully disagree. I would maybe call this "culture jamming",

I realise we are opening a can of worms here but by perspective on "hacking"
is a almost Gnostic one. I think hacking is about knowledge of how the
system works, and using this, particularly where the system works in a
different way then how it looks like it works or how it's designer intended
it to work or it's general users think it works.

Of course; what you mention can and often is a part of that but for me the
focus is on knowledge. For example; if your school buys a thousand iPod's to
distribute recordings of lectures you are "hijacking" a commercial product
but I wouldn't say you "hacked" it.

Oh, yes, and I wouldn't be typing this on Ubuntu if it hadn't been for the
corporate adoption of Linux on servers and I could never have bought the
laptop I have at the price it cost without the general popularity of
Windows, largely in the corporate world.

To make a hairpin-curve back to the topic; according to one text I read
years ago (sadly I forgot which one) one of the core aspects that keeps
music interesting is the balance between repeated/predictable elements and
unpredictable ones. To put it very bluntly a balance between ordered
elements and chaotic ones. It makes perfect sense to me that livecoding
systems and methods would mimic this.

There are other, less philosophical reasons why a micro development process
on stage (or for friends or just one's own ears) needn't be that formal, the
results not that stable. If I just play some music for a hour and it crashes
I srug and maybe start a new song. It just doesn't matter that much. If I
were contracted to write a application to manage a bank's system for the
next ten years a crash would be a very different matter and nobody would
think it was nice if daring techniques led to unexpected results. Of course
it's different.

What would be interesting is consider if there's a need to clarify the
difference more towards a lay audience. Commands like "bigify"(sp?) and
parameters like "maybe" are quite interesting there, but I also wonder if
too much of that attitude would "spoil the soup" (or fudge). Could be a
personal question, just like a preference for a lot of surprises or a lot of
predictability in music is.

Yours,
Kas.

You are right, to some degree. The opposite holds true as well, BTW. It's
quite popular for performers to make facial expressions like they are in
pain (play a air-guitar solo, going up in pitch ending in a long, high,
modulated note, then look in the mirror!). Performers that look like they
are suffering (standing in the rain and so on) are very popular in
video-clips. These can be good performances as well, I think.

If I may for a moment talk about a personal experience; last Monday I played
live on my own sequencer, the no-graphical-feedback one I program live
(programing beats and melodies, not code). Partially due to the solid BPM,
partially to audience expectations of dance-music this is a rather intense
affair, I experience it as at least as mentally straining as livecoding. I
should also explain I started doing this partially because of a desire for
more honesty towards my audience and myself.

Last Monday was a interesting moment there because thanks to the experience
I build up I now had some (small) amount of time to also consider my
presentation and gestures (on previous gigs I would almost forget the
audience was there). I had time to spare to consider that I should hit
buttons resulting in a more dramatic change with some grace (instead of just
as fast as possible) but the most interesting moment was when I "got lost"
and needed a moment to think. I stepped back and grabbed the top of my head
with both hands for a few seconds, which is a normal gesture for me to think
under pressure.

I'm telling this because even on the spot I realised something interesting
was going on. I was consciously miming a gesture towards my audience so this
was "a lie" in your context but at the same time I was also very honestly
communicating exactly what I felt. To me it's very different if I do this
while considering if I need a build-up or a break-down next (which the
question came down to) or when I already have the next track lined up as a
perfectly mastered wave-file and just want to add visual drama. It could be
argued, BTW, that this might not matter for the audience who just want to be
entertained but I care relatively little because I started doing things in
this way mainly for my own entertainment and am perfectly up-front about
that.

Yours,
Kas.

I know this idea of deceit it laptop performance is a generally accepted one
(and enjoyed Kim's papers) ... but is it actually real?

Like probably most here I see a fair amount of laptop-based performances and
I don't think I'm alone in tending to try to sneak a peek at the screen or
position myself on a balcony to look at the performer's hands.

I think that in nearly all cases you can get a very good idea about what
kind of activity is actually going on by simply looking at the performer
move. People do "lie", for example in passionately tweaking a single
stomp-box on a send and trying to imply they are controlling the whole piece
through it, triggering the return of beats by throwing a fist in the air
while the laptop takes care of the whole track structure, but is the kind of
person who's so passionate about what goes on in performance that he's
inclined to  voice his opinion on a public forum like this one actually ever
really fooled?

We could say the general lay audience doesn't notice but if that's true
(which I wonder about) I think that means they may simply not care and be
there just to dance and/or listen. Has anybody ever actually interviewed
audience members about the performances they saw/heard as they leave a club?
I'd like to suggest actual research into this instead of more or less
blindly accepting the idea.


Yours,
Kas.

It uses paypal, so sadly not a very good exchange rate.  Once you get
past the checkout into the paypal system it will tell you before you
complete the purchase.

Subject: [livecode] an idea for a livecode environment


Hello everybody! I had an idea and I wanted to share it with you. I've
being thinking about it sometime and today I didn't went to work so I
wrote a general description of it. It's very rough on the edges and
has lots of holes, sorry :-)
Let me know what you think!


/*---*/
The user using his browser chooses from a group of rooms.

He enters one room and he sees a series of running scripts and start
listening to them.

He can edit the scripts

Every version is saved and using the web interface the user can
rollback on them and the music is also rolled back to the point of the
edit.

A room could be versioned as well

Every room and script and edit is a universally accessible resource.
They have urls:

/rooms
-> a list of rooms

/rooms/33
-> a room

/rooms/33/scripts
-> a list of scripts

/rooms/33/scripts/44
-> a script

/rooms/33/scripts/44/versions
-> a list of versions of a script

/rooms/33/scripts/44/versions/38293
-> a version of a script

And in a very RESTful [1] and http loving [2] mood all resources
accept requests of different types.

So if the user do a GET (http method) on
/rooms/33
ACCEPTing [3] responses of the type html
he will be presented with an html/flash based user interface for
editing and listening the scripts.

But if the user accept MP3 he will be presented with a mp3 stream.

For videos there could be a video stream also...


The user can be another program. Say a facebook client application
(for you to livecode with your friends :-) ).
This application is written in python and displays a text area and a
button on a fecebook canvas. When the user posts a text script using
this interface the python app do a POST on /rooms/33/scripts (passing
the user script encoded as JSON, for instance) and a new script is
created.
It can be accessed by the url
/rooms/33/scripts/88


Why I would love it:

- I would have a very interesting internet radio channels to listen at work.
- It would facilitate a lot interexchange of livecode snippets because
they would be url-addressable, browsable and searchable.
- Its Open. Everybody can see everybody livecoding on the internet.


Some problems:

- Security (very free scripts executing on the server side?)
- I'm not sure how to implement it.
       -  The web app could be done with Rails, Django
       -  The versioning with git
       -  The language of the scripts... no ideia.
       -  Where to put all these scripts running? On the web
application memory? What if we have many of instances of that
application?
- Lag. We have to cope with internet speeds so we might loose some
coder-code interactivity.

This would be nice. We've done some networked livecoding with shared 
variables, it is not so difficult (this was mainly LAN though). You 
could have a look at the network part of jitlib in SuperCollider, 
which implements a hybrid of local and distributed scope. Yet the 
security issue is not so easy to address - maybe a preliminary 
solution would be to have two levels, one at which you can do 
everything (interpret code), and one where you can only do a subset 
of things.

Yes it would be great to have a nice API for live coding!

I think security concerns would affect language choice...  You could
either make a new simple language that can't do too much, or use
something like java with a complex security framework, or a pure
functional language like haskell.  Java security is quite easy to
configure if you can bear the sun style of technical writing.  In
Haskell I guess you would have to make a monad and disable
unsafePerformIO somehow -- there is an irc bot that lets you run haskell
code safely so it can be done.

From: "marcel corso" <marcel.corso
Subject: Re: [livecode] an idea for a livecode environment


Yes!
I've been dreaming about this api for a year. I even tried to start
implementing it using the
Ruby(druby,irb,rjb) | JSyn (Client-Server)
but I got tired. It was too complicated to start... wanned to do
something simpler. With ruby.
But now I'm in love with Io(http://www.iolanguage.com/about/samplecode/).

I don't know, but I have the impression that programing music is going
to help the world in some sense. Everyday we are getting more and more
close to the computer. Making him look like us and us like him.
And if we help people to understand the computer.. the path to
unification will be shortened. heheeh sorry.
I'm kidding. But not much.

Ok. And why I think that programing music will help? It's like a
bridge. Everybody understands music somehow.
A few months ago I was drunk on a bar talking to a drunk friend and
his girlfriend. They don't have any technical or mathematical
instruction and I was surprised how they were unlighted when I showed
this program (to explain to them with the "what the hell you work
with" question):

7.times do
    mi
end

mi mi mi mi mi 7 times

And then I advanced to

8.times do |delta|
   do + delta
end

do re mi fa sol la si!!

I invented this DSL just to give them an idea... And I decided that
music was the way... As usual.. specially on bars. And it worked!

This is one of the things that fascinates me the most about
livecoding. People, looking at your screen, can grasp something very
complex, and usually so immaterial and far from most of people lifes.
Its a bit like a painting that you don't know why the painter did this
or that brush stroke but if you only care about asking yourself this
simple question you can get a broad range of emotions and 'food for
thought'.

I think that an livecode API can in the future be a very interesting
thing for the web.
You, as a developer, could, depending on the profile of the people
clicking around your web change the music everybody on the website.
Socially. DJing the web!

Or, you are there on second life or some other virtual world, flying
while dancing, surrounded by giant carrots and listening to a song
that you can easily contribute, programing... Or.. just taking a peek
at the code or something. That would be wonderful.

sorry if I get carried away. These things are a bit too geeky. :-)
but I really like what I read on this list... it gets me thinking all the time.

Aw. By the way alex, I really liked your article on livecoding and
free software. It reminded me a lot of the time I read Hacking Perl in
Nightclubs. And I agree with you that free software has everything to
do with livecoding despite the computers were build for evil,
commercial, closed reasons.

Alex,
I'd like to get in there, however, I'm not sure I have
much to offer yet. I just came across fluxus.
Intrigued by it, and livecoding, I've stumbled across
other things like processing, chuck etc.. which was, i
have to admit, pushed by the book 'Practical Ruby
Projects: Ideas for the Eclectic Programmer'

Some thoughts follow:

I've always been intrigued by lisp (((and scheme
etc..))), the notion of code=3Ddata=3Dcode, but never had
a chance to explore it fully. What struck a chord with
fluxus was the fact that, if one wanted, one could,
without sweat, have the performance modify the
performance itself, with the livecoder playing the
part of the conductor. Granted fluxus is mostly about
the visual part of livecoding, but there are other
platforms out there about manipulating sound, and
music, programmatically.=20

Because of this, I've recently come across clojure,
http://www.clojure.org. It is a lisp by all standards,
which also lets one easily interact with any java
libraries out there. I'm trying to get my hands around
clojure and see if I can contribute to livecoding
somehow.=20

I think the notion of creativity, visual or audio,
applies really well with self-modifiable systems (ala
fluxus) as well, as long as one believes that a
creator   of art can also be defined as an
orchestrator of art-creation.=20

Thoughts, comments are welcome. I'd especially welcome
opinions by folks who've done some work along these
lines that I can learn from.

Interesting you mention clojure, I watched a talk by Rich Hickey (the
creator of clojure) last night regarding concurrency and was quite
impressed.
It seems like clojure is quite well designed, full-featured language.
The only problem I have with it is that even though its a lisp, its
quite substantially different from other members of the lisp family
and I think would take some time to adjust to.

I can't speak for others on this list, but if you delve into clojure
I'd be interested to hear the results.

Apologies if I sound bloody ignorant in this:

I gather that most linux-based audio programming systems would be
playing with some basic interface provided by the system. I wonder
for instance if some basic sounds can be produced using the shell
or some kind of very rudimentary program that instructs the sound
card to, say, produce a square or sine wave. As it is a stream of numbers,
I wonder what is that underlying process which converts it to sound?

If I'm not wrong, both pure data and ChucK would be using this
same underlying system in Linux. Can anyone elucidate with
an example? I'm just trying to look beneath the surface here...

So I have ALSA on my box. And I want to talk to my sound card through ALSA(
do I have an option?), but in the command line or a shell script.

Is there a way to do this? I'd be very grateful for any insights.

Looking at portaudio -- its definitely not very far from the train of

I'll have to play around a bit more to understand it better. Thanks!

in unix everything is a file, even your soundcard output.
so just send the "numbers" (in binary that is) to the correct file.

like that:
# cat /dev/hda > /dev/dsp

agreed, it is not the most creative example; i like this one better:
# find /usr/src/linux-headers-2.6.24-16 -type f -exec cat '{}' \; > /dev/dsp

however, you need OSS for this (luckily there is the OSS emulation for ALSA)

Ah! But then one could -instead of a file's contents- also use the build-in
math and scripting functions for synthesis....

Not at all practical but I'd love to see it done.

I don't have an hda file in my /dev. But I tried looking into /dev/dsp
using cat and I got a seemingly unending series of
"~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~" (tildez)

I had a few basic tenets behind this:

1. Minimise the middlemen software between oneself and the "unix file" that
IS
the sound. If you were to be able to write simply numbers to this file, the
math
can actually become more fun because it would be a journey of mathematical
expression, rather than learning standard or traditional synthesis/analysis
concepts
passed on by others into a language like ChucK or PD (which are great too,
but..).

2. I hate dictionaries, and all (correct me) computing languages require the
repeated reference to, or rote memorization of, some dictionary or the
other. The ChucK manual for
instance, or Python manual, or PD manual. They are simply dictionaries of
functions
or classes which point to some abstract manipulation of numbers or the
other.

3. Just introduce me to the sound card, and let us develop our own
rapport/language
in which we shall converse.

4. I don't want to master Linux just to understand how sound is produced
from it. Perhaps
thats too much to ask?

I can see the concept of minimising the middle-man in software but on the
level of what you will actually write not much need to be different.  CK an
SC (PD is obviously a bit different being graphical) are perfectly fine with
with sending the outcome of a equation straight to the output. You lose the
nice ready-made Ugens and their optimisation but you can. I imagine that at
that point shell-scripting and ChucK would start to look a lot alike as math
is math.

Erm..... you may want to look at a manual for the Unix shell (type "man man"
at the terminal to get you the manual entry for the manual command). It has
quite a large dictionary, I fear.

Have a look at Forth. Forth (in some versions) can boot straight into Forth,
skipping the OS altogether, at that point the *only* thing you can do is
develop a language to converse in... with no middle man. I'd take a ancient
computer for this, 8086 or so because there are good reasons for middle-men
on modern ones.

I dunno.... me, I just want world-peace, 6 or so more hours to the day, a
bit of love every once in a while.... and another cup of coffee. Some of
that might be a bit much to ask so I started with the most attainsable one.

If you don't want to master Linux I wouldn't use it for synthesis directly.
Middle-men don't bug me as long as they are transparent; I don't feel the
middle-men that go from a value at ChucK's abstraction of the DAC, to this
file, to a driver, to some little buffer on the card to, a current on the
actual DAC to, a offset in the speaker's position, to vibrarting air to me
hearing the sounds that objectionable.

As I see things modern computers are too large and complex to have minute
controll over all the details, I'm fine with pretending the VM is the
computer and ignoring the middle-men altogether aside from occasionally
configuring a driver or buying a new soundcard.

But hey; it's your concept and it's a commendable concept so why not? See if
and where your get stuck, at the very least you'll learn stuff.

Cheers,
Kas.

I guess the issue I am addressing is the "combinatorial efficiency" of any
alphabet, at the point where it is being encoded with meaning and becoming a
language. That aside,...at some point in the nearing present, a lot of live
music is going to be made with the help of small microcontrollers instead of
laptops, in fact, it already is.

I am sure what I'm asking for is too much, it isn't a joke. I was able to
learn whatever little
computing (language(s)) I do because I am fairly well educated in English,
which has played middleman to this part of the world for 300 years. I just
want to be able to encounter a medium as universal as the drum (bang that
thing!) within computer music.

That's precisely my fear. I don't trust things I don't fully comprehend.
Because that makes me defendant on someone who I don't know. Speaking of
drivers, I have no sound in my XP because Conexant don't love me, and no
wifi in my Ubuntu because Broadcomm wants my blood. By the time I figure out
how to write my own, I am dead certain that music would have left my life
for good.

No, it's not even a concept yet. It's alright, if I could explain it
completely, I would have made it already :)

Yes, I see... But I'd point out that while the drum is universal, making it
speak in a elloquent way requires a lot of practice. I'd reccomend that you
try to get a lot of practice coding.

No? hmmmm, trust can take many forms. I trust my friends even if I don't
fully comprehend them, based on years of experience with them. I trust
public transports, even if I don't fully comprehend them and they could
theoretically go off in random directions instead of the one labeled on
them. I suppose this is a matter of how much I comprehend them, the risk an=

I feel more or less the same about soundcards and their drivers.

Here's the audio section of a Chua oscillator simulation from Marcel 
Hendrix's iForth:

	/PARSE WAV-FLUSH ;

The current release uses the ALSA OSS emulation as a sound interface. 
There's a native ALSA interface that's almost finished, and Jack and OS 
X sound support are in the works. You can, of course to the extent that 
Linux, Windows or OS X will let you, program directly to the hardware. 
iForth is a native compiler, arguably the fastest Intel Forth, arguably 
as fast as gcc.

There are many branches of mathematics. Sound synthesis languages are 
a mathematics of sound, which have to take into account that the 
being of sound is more than its waveform. Just as any mathematics, it 
is not trivial to describe something formally. 'Low level' system 
commands may well turn out to be less mathematical than 'high level' 
programming languages. Despite this, it is a nice project! If you 
want to be close to discourses such as those of mathematical logic 
though, Haskell may be a good alternative.

How would you do if you wanted to do the same on say.. the screen (ie,

That was like kung-fu, mate :)  It moves!

I think this is precisely part A of what I've been
looking for, part B would be to write a series of numbers to a
file and be able to hear that pure dac-ly.

Thanks a lot, Adrian.

I think many times when I follow a mathematical derivation, or proof,
I have  felt that it was a sort of code stirring visualizations in my head.
As I continue to believe (perhaps wrongly) - we have surrounded ourselves
by walls of categories that shouldn't exist in the first place. Math and
code
are pretty much the same to me, and there are moments when sound is
image, and vice versa. I don't believe I'm talking to a screen right now.

Now Master Kassen will say that "but categories are useful", and "they help
us
organise our thoughts in a constructive way". Of course he's right, but
I persist...:)

Kassen is quite pleased right now that he at least -apparently- mastered
"the art of being there without being there", quite convenient, I think I'l=

stay out more often.

I think (that to me) the way livecoding looks at "math as categories" is
different from the limitations you are talking about.

To me statements like "This is a table" (still fine for sitting on), "you
can't do that" (why not?), etc, sound like they could be limiting if you're
not carefull. Also see "Maria is a witch" and "Jack is a communist"(The
World et all, prehistory to now) This is different from "There is a
oscillator and it's name is beep and it's signal goes to the output", there
it's not our thought being structured but the "thought" of our computer.

Call me a wanna-be fashist if you like but I think categories for
structuring thought are a lot more fun if I'm the one doing the structuring
(as opposed to -say- a government or marketing agency).

I'm not sure this helps as it still implies you need to be carefull with th=
e
exact meaning of the categories that you use there (as Julian said). This i=
s
-interestingly- quite opposite from "limiting categories" in day to day lif=
e
where the trouble comes in the form of *inexact* meaning.

In this sense I find livecoding liberating.

Not sure that's non-trivial to point out or even helpfull but when one is
labeled as belonging to the "master" category one is basically forced into
at least make some attempt at saying something wise.

Um, I found this quite relevant:
http://everything2.com/e2node/catting%2520weird%2520things%2520to%2520%252Fdev%252Faudio
(copyasted below)

While you may not be aware of it, most modern
*n?x<http://everything2.com/title/%252An%253Fx>systems come with a
built-in industrial
music <http://everything2.com/title/industrial%2520music> generator. This
generator consists of three parts:

   1. The concept of devices <http://everything2.com/title/devices> as
files<http://everything2.com/title/files>
   2. Standard input
<http://everything2.com/title/input>/output<http://everything2.com/title/output>
   redirection <http://everything2.com/title/redirection> to/from files
   (implemented with > <http://everything2.com/title/%2526gt%253B> and
<<http://everything2.com/title/%2526lt%253B>in
   Bash <http://everything2.com/title/Bash>)
   3. /dev/audio <http://everything2.com/title/%252Fdev%252Faudio>

That's about all you need. The output of just about anything, most notably
cat <http://everything2.com/title/cat>, can be interpreted as raw
sound<http://everything2.com/title/sound>data and sent to the speakers
instead of the monitor. Most of the time this
will just give you weird static <http://everything2.com/title/static>. Try cat
/dev/urandom <http://everything2.com/title/%252Fdev%252Furandom> >
/dev/audio (outputs literally random
<http://everything2.com/title/random>sound). If you want something
more meaningful, try simple
patterns <http://everything2.com/title/patterns> of values; the most simple
value, and a good place to start, would be
yes<http://everything2.com/title/yes>> /dev/audio,
which outputs a high whining as the value 'y' is sent as audio over and
over.

The trick is finding ways to get interesting patterns out of the speakers.
One way to do this is to write simple programs:

int n=0, i=1;
for(;;) {
     cout << char(n+=i);
     if (n>255 || i<=0) {i++; n = n % 255;}
}

However your best bet is to try to find something large with a repetitive
structure <http://everything2.com/title/structure> but varying information--
large data files for example. And the two best examples of this, if you ask
me, would be cat /dev/hda1 > /dev/audio (or your equivalent) or cat
/proc/kcore > /dev/audio. Core <http://everything2.com/title/Core> is more..
well, hardcore, but catting your hard drive into /dev/audio is uncontestedly
the best. You get weird, vaguely looping
noise<http://everything2.com/title/noise>,
shifting, completely unpredictable, infinitely varied but usually with a
constant feel to it. Plus if there are any sound
files<http://everything2.com/title/sound%2520files>on your drive saved
in a
lossless <http://everything2.com/title/lossless> format they just play at
random and then disappear back into the soup. Someday i'm going to tape 45
minutes worth of my linuxppc
<http://everything2.com/title/linuxppc>partition, then drive down to
the
local college radio station <http://everything2.com/title/KTRU> during the
ambient <http://everything2.com/title/ambient> show and ask them to play it.
I doubt they'd be disappointed. > /dev/audio music can be surprisingly good,
and the quality levels of hard drives tend to approach that of
coil<http://everything2.com/title/coil>.

This is Quoth, an excellent work by Craig Latta.=20
It is a "dynamic interactive fiction system".

Hi Kas--

      I've made some progress on Quoth; it had been using Squeak device 
drivers that were Windows-specific, but after my Windows laptop died I 
rewrote them using Port[Audio,MIDI], which runs on several host 
platforms. I presented Quoth running on a Powerbook to the Bay Area 
Computer Music Technology group from meetup.com a few months ago.

      I'm working on a release of Squeak which will make Squeak 
application deployment reasonable, for 2008-06-20 (solstice), and a 
Quoth release for 2008-09-22 (equinox).


      thanks!

Oh, wow! I didn't dare ask that because it might be your private personal

Greetings,

To my great surprise, provisional permission has been granted to
organize a 'TOPLAP Pub Night' at ICMC this year in Belfast. As no
feedback besides was given, I will endeavor to clarify what exactly
has been approved. In the meantime, I wanted to solicit your
participation and guidance.

First, if you will be at ICMC this year and could do a livecoding
performance, say aye.

Second, if you have some ideas for organizing things, let me know. My
first idea was just to get an idea of participation, then request the
time we think we need, and divide into performers, and maybe an OSC-
synched jam at the end (for which we can coordinate the standards for
ahead of time).

By the end of the week I will submit additional information of those
who may perform.

best,

Graham

--
PS Proposal below

Proposal: TOPLAP Pub Night
We propose a night of livecoding performances from members of TOPLAP,
a group devoted
to livecoding, preferably as an off-ICMC concert night.

Requirements:
a projector
a sound system
(pending availability, we can hold a headphone concert with a headphone amps)

Organization:
We will solicit performances from TOPLAP members attending ICMC from
the toplap mailing
list, and from events such as the LOSS Livecode Festival.

Aye'll be there too. Could be a live coding invasion; I should warn on his 
behalf that Matthew Yee-King will be performing his live percussion+live 
coding work in a separate ICMC session, all going well.

I guess you have to send ICMC the details requested and then they schedule 
as they can fit? So I assume no specific details yet. I've already booked 
to be around at ICMC all week, but I expect some others will be dropping in 
and out more selectively.

pd~graz (that is: me and others :-) [1]) have been accepted with our 
collaborative live coding set "blind date" too.


since one of our group will not be able to attend and we the more the 
merrier, we are looking for other people who might want to join:
you should be fluent in Pd and not afraid of a white canvas.
here is what we have submitted: http://pd-graz.mur.at/concerts/icmc08/

I saw the Wire review this morning; it's actually quite nice! I was 
expecting something a little different, more aggressively opposed perhaps. 
There are name checks for Ron, The Hub, slub and Redfrik, and a fair enough 
depiction of the scene, give or take some possible over-categorisation 
along the coder-musician continuums.

So yes, you should all check it out.

http://www.granularsynthesis.com is seeking to include more music. Of
course any granular synthesis recording is still under copyright, so
permission is needed for all pieces, so there is not a lot
there......yet ;) 

The book "Microsound" by Curtis Roads contains a CD with a lot of good
examples, and excerpts, including the early classic "nscor". 
http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?tid=8587&ttype=2

I like "Ocean" from the "Pacific" CD by Barry Truax, in which he
stretches out ocean waves until time is almost standing still. Barry has
some excerpts of his work on his site:

Super late notification, but I'm doing a talk for Scheme UK this evening,

---------------------------------------------

Scheme UK Meeting : Fluxus: scheme livecoding

Livecoding is the name given to improvised programming, usually in front
of an audience, with screen projection to allow viewers to connect the
construction of a program along with it's audio/visual/olfactory output.

Fluxus is a rapid prototyping, livecoding and playing/learning environmen=
t
for 3D graphics and games. It extends PLT Scheme with graphical commands
and can be used within it's own livecoding environment or from within the
DrScheme IDE.

Subject: [livecode] prehistory of live coding review - The Wire June 2008


A prehistory of Live Coding
TOPLAP CD

Four years ago, in a moky bar in Hamburg, Toplap was formed -- an
organisation dedicated to promoting live algorithm programming.  So far,
so niche.  Defying expectation however, it has since exploded into a
fully functioning electronic music scene, with hundreds of practitioners
improvising with live coding languages such as SuperCollider and ChucK.
That is, writing, rewriting and modifying music software on the fly
during performance (often with the rapidly changing code projected on a
screen). 
  The cream of this scene's live recorded output has now been collated
on Toplap's inaugural release.  Despite superficially geeky origins --
many performers are coders first, musicians second -- the music here is
stacked with depth, guts and soul.  Opener "Water Surface" by Ron
Kuivila is a featherlight study, shimmering with static broken by bursts
of bee-like feedback.  In contrast, The Hub's "Hub x 6" is an
analogue-style fun fest of farty trumpet bursts and spaceship noise.
RedFrik's ticklish "Aug 19" is Luke Vibert-style acid, but with enough
rhythmic aberrations to take it beyond twee.  "20060401folded" by scene
forerunners Slub is a compelling, edgy slice of rollercoaster Techno.
In truth, it's hard to believe much of the music here is essentially
freewheeling software reined in by finger tapping humans.  Live coding
has so far flourished, but under a bushel.  Perhaps it's time the rest
of us got a look in.

Hi all,

Dave and I are doing a talk this thursday if anyone's in town:

*5 JUNE with ALEX MCLEAN & DAVE GRIFFITHS

Live Coding

Live coders program in conversation with their machine, dynamically
adding instructions and functions to running programs. Here there is no
distinction between creating and running a piece of software - its
execution is controlled through edits to its source code. Live coding
has recently become popular in performance, where software is written
before an audience in order to generate music and video for them to
enjoy. McLean and Griffiths have played around Europe together with
Adrian Ward as the live coding band =E2=80=9Cslub=E2=80=9D. They will talk =
about the
history and practice of live coding, and give some demos of their own
live coding environments.

ALEX MCLEAN has been triggering distorted kick drum samples with Perl
scripts for far too long. He is a PhD student at Goldsmiths Digital
Studios.

DAVE GRIFFITHS writes programs to make noises, pictures and animations.
He makes film effectis software and computer games.

Dave & Alex are both members of the Openlan free software artists
collective and the TOPLAP organisation for live algorithm promotion.
slub.org ; toplap.org ; pawfal.org/openlab ; pawfal.org/dave ; yaxu.org

THE THURSDAY CLUB is an open forum discussion group for anyone
interested in the theories and practices of cross-disciplinarity,
interactivity, technologies and philosophies of the state-of-the-art in

=EF=BB=BF
I should add that it's from 6pm until 8pm.  It's in the Seminar Rooms
at Ben Pimlott Building (Ground Floor, right), Goldsmiths,
University of London, New Cross, SE14 6NW

It's free, and no booking is required.

Dudes,

Sadly, final approval for this was denied. I have not received any feedback,
just that the proposal was not programmed. So barring further notice assume
it's off.

My tentative plans were to appear there to show off Mused, but we'll see.

Maybe next year. Or next LOSS Livecode. Or something at UPF.

Until then, keep hot-swapping your methods, temporally recursing, injecting
your state, programming conversationally, and feeding back your source (Live
coding for free, McLean).

=EF=BB=BFDear list

I found the rejection by ICMC quite irritating and have made some
enquiries with some musicians/ promoters I know in Belfast. A nice chap
called Barry Lynn (Boxcutter) has provided me with some email addresses
for possible co-organisers as well as saying:=20

'If you don't get anywhere with either of them get back to me, I'd say
between myself and David [...] we could hire out a small rig and venue
and make it happen!'

So - if we are still up for doing a toplap night, drop me a line!

Nice one Matthew, if you need any help I'm sure there would be many
volunteers myself included.

We (dorkbotlondon) will likely hold an outdoor 'burningdork' camp for
people doing strange things with electricity from August 29th -
September 1st, in a peaceful campsite somewhere near London.  Live
coders welcome!  But it overlaps slightly with ICMC, so I could really
do with knowing what the schedule for that will be, I hope they post it
soon...

cheers!

**Piksel08: code dreams
   december 4-7 2008
   Bergen, Norway

How does code dream? What are the dreams of code?

Piksel08 examines the other side of code, an alternative side to a hard-coded
reality of work and play. Open hardware and free software project a utopic
vision, yet exist within economies of capital, the dream factory of
mainstream technology. Within the chance meeting of sewing machine and
umbrella on the dissecting table, hardware and software are flattened.

Piksel08: code dreams explores the dreams of this soft machine; bachelors
coding for pleasure, reverse engineering paranoiac constructs of the real,
automatic coding practice, soft hardware, and everyday magic.

<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>

**open call:

1. Installations

Projects related to the code dreams theme including but not restricted to:
reverse engineering, soft hardware, code poetry, novel instruction sets,
invisible exploration, ghosted computation...

programmed by and running on free and open source software and/or open/DIY
hardware.

2. Audiovisual performance

Live art realised by the use of free and open source software. We specially
encourage live coding and DIY hardware projects to apply.

3. Software/Hardware

Innovative DIY hardware and audiovisual software tools or software art
released under an open licence.

<<<<<<  Deadline - august 15. 2008 >>>>>>

Please use the online submit form at:
http://piksel.no/piksel08/subform.html

or send documentation material - preferably as a URL to online
documentation with images/video to piksel08@hiddenno

<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>

**subsections:

**real code

real.co.[de][re] actively explores code which has strong effects on
the real, constructing the world through prediction and
description. The twelve hour real.co.[de][re] session will attempt the
active construction of a working code model (of any form) which
addresses a flattening of the distinction between software and
hardware, to resolve a new political reference for real core code.

**abstract code

Abstract code is software whose results can be invisible, a software
implementing different layers of action at the same time.
Abstract code is a connection to parallel worlds, a poetic formula dealing
with outer forces. Code is art, its action is subtile, effective, magic.

procedural text

maledictions, oracles, iambi, hymn, formula,
refrains, hypnotic sentences, prayers, and other.

I can't do the 29th for sure due to dorkcamp.  Could probably do 28th
but earlier in the week is better.

if technically possible (tunnel through php script something to a  
computer running sc), i could offer to participate remotely from  
japan.  and i'm sure others as well - the andrews?
i imagine a short session making the most noise possible and then  
crash.  some sort of beauty in that - to crash both here and there.

Now that's a nice example of musical data-compression! The final word in
those unpleasant compressed-audio-format wars!

Which reminds me of this;
http://fora.tv/2006/06/26/Will_Wright_and_Brian_Eno

That's a talk between Will Wright (Spore) and Brian Eno which goes into many
aspects of generative systems, amongst other things data compression. Might
well be interesting/stimulating to list members, even if most of it
approaches generative systems from very different angles from what is
typically done here.

Yours,
Kas.

Subject: [livecode] more vocable synthesis



I got a new prototype working:

  http://doc.gold.ac.uk/~ma503am/alex/poei-hoio-_-topo-_-_/

The recording clips a bit, and isn't in stereo (you should be able to
hear half the mesh in each ear), and google video transcoded it to be
barely readable at all...  You can look at the avi version to at least
fix the last problem though.

Feedback most welcome...

I took the AVI route.

Looks nice, I liked how it comes across as quite simple yet very "playable";
of the livecoding performances I saw and downloaded so far this strikes me
as the closest to traditional musicianship I've seen yet but I can't quite
place my finger on why this is exactly. Might be the relation between the
(apparent) simplicity of the system and the continuity of the editing.

Looks very accessible as well, both towards the performer and the audience.

Thanks for posting this!

Kas.

Thanks for the feedback Kassen...  I should point out that I present it
here as an instrument useful for livecoders rather than an example of
live coding itself. =20

I think live coding is about building a sequence of abstract
imperatives/functions structured by ifs, fors, recursion etc.  Here I'm
just playing with a straightforward sequence of sounds.

In the video I do jump out to tweak some values in the Perl but that's
hardly live coding either.

What I have been doing in other trials is live coding regexes over the
string of vocables.  For example, changing all 'c's temporarily to 'm's.
I've also added regexes to add some non-determinism, for example a
question mark after a letter makes it only have influence half the time
on average, and a colon between two letters makes it choose between
them.  These are quite quick to type:

    $word =3D~ s/(.)\?/rand() > 0.5 ? $1 : ''/eg;
    $word =3D~ s/(.):(.)/rand() > 0.5 ? $1 : $2/eg;

... so quite possible to do during a performance.  Regexen seem a good
bedfellow to vocable words, placing so much meaning in single
characters.

The following instructions for making a sound:

  Hit loose, dampened drum outwards with heavy stiff mallet, then hit=20
  the middle of the drum with a lighter mallet while tightening the=20
  skin slightly and finally hit the edge of the skin with the same=20
  light mallet while loosening and releasing the dampening

can be expressed with the following:

  =EF=BB=BFkopatu

Yes, I saw it as "text editing as a interface for sequencing" but I'd be
hard-pressed to say where that stops and livecoding begins. I have no real
answers to that question.

Yes, that makes perfect sense. If you are sequencing by editing text
traditional text operations like search&replace become musical transitions.
I've just implemented something along those lines on my joystick sequencer
as well. I'm not sure what it's good for in the more extreme cases (like
turning all bass-line "E" notes into reversed highhats) but it sounded like
a nice idea to experiment with so I did it anyway and I'll see where it
takes me.

That's a sequencer in ChucK heavily inspired by txt editor commands for data
entry by Antimon. Sadly it takes a rather high amount of CPU. I've been
meaning to try to figure out why and either do some optimisation on it or
borrow some of it's concepts for fun when I don't feel like carying a huge
arcade stick. I don't think I linked to that yet but I might be mistaken.

One other note; I found that if you make advanced ways of getting data into
a sequencer in realtime it helps a lot if you also implement advanced ways
of getting data out of it again or the system will start to become inclined
towards endless buildups. I pointed that out in the linked topic as well but
it's a issue I found to be quite important.

Nice job regardless of what we call this style of performance.

Maybe a tentative approach would be to say that it starts when it is 
public thought, i.e. where new concepts are formed. Then it depends 
on the observer/player. Another would be to say it starts where the 
elements that form the sounds are not related by a simple direct 
mapping, but by higher order abstractions.

Yes, those are my thoughts as well... but if Alex were to claim his video
clearly demonstrated "public thought" I'd have to agree with him as well and
you can have "higher order mappings" (to some admittedly low degree) in
sequencing for example in trackers or in Antimon's "comandline sequencer".
Or for example in re-patching a Serge TKB. We know what we mean but I don't
think it's so easy to define it in some non-ambiguous way.

I don't think that's bad at all, BTW. Hybrid systems are interesting. For
ChucK there's the "non specific" side to the Audicle that has a more or less
traditional sequencer interface that can then trigger behaviour in code. I'm
also reminded of Luc's (I think he's on the list now as well?) performance
in Utrecht where he made use of MAX/MSP's graphical nature to build a
slider-based sequencer and proceeded to play that combined with changing
it's workings. There's probably a lot more done but those are the ones that
pop up in my head right now.

I imagine this connecting of levels of scope, of higher and lower order
influence could be a good way of "getting the thought to the public", that's
still a tricky fronteer in "public thought".

Hi. I just read about this in a gaming magazine.

http://www.retrodev.co.uk/MiscGames/NakedGame/TheNakedGame.html

It's a flash-remake of Pong, where you can comment out lines of code,
and the game will instantly respond according to your changes.=20

I think this is a perfect way to teach non-programmers about code, and a
great tool for debugging - but you already knew that. :-)

Let me try to address this by sidestepping the literal questions, semantics
and natural language tends to become quite messy quite fast.

What I find especially attractive about improvised live performance and in
particular about electronic improvised live performance is seeing the
performer run into trouble, look for a solution and solve the matter. This
can come down to questions like "how do I go from this dense (musical) loop
to a break in a clean way?" or "why don't I hear my leadline?". Often we'll
see the performer struggle, try some stuff, then smile, hit some buttons and
the music will change. Ideally as a audience we will feel his emotions to
some degree. To me this is one of the most appealing aspects of watching
live performances and I hurry to say you can see the exact same thing happen
in some DJ sets, particularly when watching two "tag-teaming" DJ's or
acoustical ensembles.

However it may not always be clear what instruments are being played or how
they are connected and configured ehnce tthe nature of tthe question may not
be clear. We can follow some of this process from the facial expressions and
body language of the performer as well as in the music itself but the exact
nature of the problem experienced by the performer and it's solution may
well be unclear.

Livecoding on the other hand could be said to focus on opening up and
emphasising this exact aspect of improvised performance. I find this process
more appealing to witness then a demonstration of a previously developed
technique (though that too can be very pleasant).

Once again; I realise this doesn't answer you exact questions but I do
suspect it addresses the underlying issue.

Yours,
Kas.

Tricky...  Maybe playing is interacting with the world/others, thinking
is interacting with yourself and acting is interacting with the world
using someone else's representation of it.

This would suggest that thinking always involves some kind of visualisation...
This is not the case for everyone; some people can't think visually.

Is thought always organising?

I don't know what thought is, but consider if these events fit your  
definition:

- A bird flew over my head, I noticed it but didn't know what it was,  
I kept on reading my book.
- Someone speaks to me in a language that I don't understand. I feel  
I understand.
- I'm playing table tennis, my shoelace is untied and I keep thinking  
about it, but I play successfully.
- When programming I have a problem. I perform some trial-error tests  
and one of them works. (I didn't know what I was doing)
- A 6 months old lies on his/her back and searches for his/her dummy.  
She/he has a project.
- etc. : )

I don't know what public thought is either, but I'd say it would be  
some system like traffic rules.

I come clean -- these are ideas taken from Peter G=C3=A4rdenfors' theory of
Conceptual Spaces.  The idea that there is a geometrical level of
representation between (and complimentary to) symbolic representation
and ANN-like representation.  He sees the geometrical level as the
conceptual one, where semantic meaning is represented.

You have many streams (dimensions) of input coming in, in this case you
failed to translate this high dimensional form into a low dimensional
geometrical space you can perceive things in.

Meaning exists in the geometrical relationships in your head and not in
the outside world.  We try and harmonise with others but sometimes fail.
Sometimes it doesn't matter.

Or maybe you mean you didn't understand the symbolic language someone
was speaking but you get some understanding from their movements, etc?

I'd have thought the pre-occupation with your shoelace would have
distracted you from the movement of the ball.  You are clearly a master
of thought. :)

Yep it seems quite a vague process...  Programming does not feel like
straightforward symbol manipulation, the symbols somehow seem just what
is left behind.

S/he has far too many muscles to control, the project is relating
together all the possible muscle movements into a higher level, low
dimensional space that s/he can move and think in.

I'd say spatialisation rather than visualisation.  For example in my
opinion sound events are also organised according to geometrical
relationships.

> Is thought always organising?

Well often catastrophes occur that shake things up causing us to
re-organise in a different way.  But to think about something I think we
have to compare it with other things we already know, through deciding
the dimensions along which they are similar or different.  This is a
process of geometrical organisation I think.

could it be that geometry is only a way to think about thinking?

or maybe thought is what shakes things up? This is at least what live

Yes I notised the reference of G=E4rdenfors. I haven't read his book but
it strikes me as very top-down and disembodied view of thinking. But

That's a very French statement. Surely the person speaking is saying
something with meaning? We use language to convey meaning.
Of course the problem of hermeneutics enters the picture here.

I'd say that s/he is thinking already, s/he just doesn't have control =20=

I think we compose and perceive sound in geometrical space.  We choose
sounds close to each other or far apart.  This distance is similarity,
across the dimensions of timbre that we are focusing on
(graininess/distortion/pitch/whatever).  

Synths tend to have continuous controllers for controlling the sound,
trying to give us something like a dimension of perception to tweak. 

The Klee Sequencer is a counter-example...

yes, my suspicion was somehow that this type of conceptualising sound 
may be internalised synthesiser techniques (or greek physics) in the 
first place.

Heh, yes.  I'm aware that I have little background in philosophy,
semiotics, cognitive science, etc so have little in the way of pinches
of salt to take his ideas with.  But I really enjoyed his book.

Yes we can communicate meaning between us.  But we all know what a messy
and error-prone process that is, and after a conversation we can still
have a very different idea about what we talked about...  Listening to
the 'moral maze' on bbc radio reveals how useless attempts to convey
meaning between different viewpoints can be.  I think music could be all
about making and breaking unity between the geometrical structures in
the musicians through conversation via instruments...

Yes it seems to me that there is very little happening inside the head
of a new baby, and the process of becoming happens through mapping and
exploring the world around over 80 years or so.

Yes, I agree. For relationships like "this process runs parallel with that"
then yes, probably. But for "is similar to" or "is followed by" it becomes
more vague and for things like "depends on" I don't experience any internal
visualisation at all.

This;

public class Bang extends Event
 {
 //marvellously interesting functionality goes here
 }

clearly defines a relationship between two sorts of things; the existing
"Event" and my new "Bang". The link is quite strong but I don't visualise it
at all.

It might be interesting to see if or how this differs between the sexes.
According to some research (most) men navigate by internalising a model of
the terrain while (most) women supposedly use a series of linked
relationships between places.

I feel this difference is quite relevant. In coding the programmer may have
a larger "map" in his head of how it should all work but the audience is
left to try to imagine it based on smaller elements and their relationships,
for example a function call expressing a relationship between one object and
another.

While spatial and visual analogies are powerful and useful they do have
limits There are plenty of things that are fairly straightforward in
text-based programming but that I wouldn't like to do in -say- PureData. I
also find that mental spatial analogies speed up my thinking for 1, 2 and 3
dimensional arrays but for higher order arrays or when using asociative
indexing is breaks down and instead starts slowing me down. 4d space it hard
to imagine visually yet I'm (mostly) fine with dealing with 4d arrays on a
more abstract level.

It's not at all surprising that "public thought" runs into questions about
cognitive processes... but it's a bit of a shame we (humanity) knew very
little about those when it comes down to it.

Yours,
Kas.

It's not the gender element I'm after here as such. It's just that I know
for certain that is a field where research has been done on how people
differ in using spatial reasoning. Likely there are many more differences
that vary according to many factors but I have no idea to what degree that
has been researched. Surroundings and gender are both relatively easy to
check for which is probably what those researchers thought as well in a hard
field to do research at all like that.

I should have been more clear that I was using gender and internal
representation of surroundings as a example and not as a topic on itself. I
would still be interested to hear whether those differences in that type of
visualisation would carry over to dealing with program structures but likely
this list is far too small as a sample group to say anything significant
about that, for one thing I seem to remember one occasion where it was
painfully clear Nescivi (f) had a much better internal map of the city then
I (m) did.

To continue that line of reasoning; if we -just for kicks- assume different
people use visual analogies to different degrees and in different ways (this
seems safe to me) that might explain why we all prefer certain syntaxes over
others, even if many things we do could be accomplished just as well in
other languages and systems. We may need more cognitive scientists here....

If anybody has links to data about other variables that might affect
internal visualisations I'd be quite interested. Gender may be nice and
clear (most of the time) but saying anything about it tends to run into
political discussion painfully quickly.

I hope that clarifies?

Yours,
Kas.

Yes! I wondered whether you implied any idea of an innate capacity 
that differs.

Gender appers to be easy to categorise and you are right if you say 
that this is a reason that often it is used as a basis for feasable 
research. I guess it is political because one may wonder what kind of 
scientific result this is supposed to be. I think self-observation is 
so much more valuable than this type of emptiricism.

Maybe, but nobody grew up hearing lots of SuperCollider or ChucK, yet some

much sense.

I suspect this could be related to internal representations, at least in
part though that's just a lay-man's guess.

Well, I do imagine that such factors might influence the way some people
structure their thought and code. This could mean some might feel more at
home with certain tasks or syntaxes. That is not to say I was speculating
any one approach would be "better", both music and code are too diverse for
that.

We might speculate that a livecoding performance  by somebody who thinks in
a ways similar to what we use might be easier to follow while a performance
by somebody with a radically different "inlook" (as opposed to "outlook" bu=
t
applied to internal visualisations) could be more exciting?

Here is a slight update on this. The kind chaps in Belfast are currently
trying to get a confirmation from this venue :

=EF=BB=BFHello list

Just to keep you up to date:

1. A guy called Ajay Kapur has been in touch. He wants to put on a
unofficial ICMC Indian Electronic music night and we have discussed
joining forces.=20

2. We have a concrete fix on a venue now - =EF=BB=BFhttp://www. blackboxb=
elfast.
com/. It is available Mon 25th or Weds 27th. Looks like the best day to
do it is Monday 25th as Weds 27th is the banquet.=20

All emails attached...

If no-one objects, I will book the venue for Monday 25th and join forces
with Ajay, which will make for some interesting music and a larger
audience.=20

best

Matthew

-----------
Dear Ajay

Here's the latest info from my man in Belfast:

-----------

Hi Matthew,
Think I've found the best possible venue for this, a new venue in the
Cathedral Quarter of belfast

http://www. blackboxbelfast. com/

They have a front room that holds maybe 100 people, projector and screen
included in the booking fee (=C2=A3100). It's available on the 25th or 27=
th,
have you any preference? Let me know and i'll get it confirmed.
What do you think is needed promotion-wise? Do you want to make a poster
for the event? Is the core audience gonna be SARC related people do you
think?
Cheers
Barry.

-------

It's only available Monday and Weds, so if Weds is the banquet, Monday
is the day if we want to do it there.=20

Does anyone have opinions on this one? My point of view is - let's go
for Monday at this venue as it seems pretty concrete+pro and let's split
the =C2=A3100 booking fee...=20

cheers

Matthew=20

Somewhere late September In The Hague (NL) there will be the Today's Art

I have little idea of what this actually means I'd like to apply for a
TOPLAP "approval and seal".

The proformance will consist of me programming in the MiniAudicle ChucK

or so minutes) "Disaster management, pretending I meant it that way and
averting crashes" (40 minutes), perhaps I will compose/perform two such
cycles, depending on how well the "crash aversion" element turns out.

No backup will be used, aside possibly from the tradtional ChucKian
technique of "blaming Ge". I do believe there is a sold chance of "public
thought", seeing as how I'm on at the beginning of the night, meaning there
will be little opportunity to spend drink-tickets before my set.

So.. that's my application, now what?

Yes... well.... I have to say that I was just wondering what the "TOPLAP
lawyer" intended to do with my old body. And here I was thinking that in
livecoding people were supposed to be after one's mind... :=ACp


Speaking of bodies and livecoding (warning, wild tangent will follow);

Some time ago I saw a installation at a exhibit of work by media technology
students from Leiden (it was and still may be at the Rotterdam museum of
photography). The installation consisted of a arcade cabinet and a helmet.
The helmet made it impossible for the wearer to see and was equipped with
headphones. The headphones gave instructions (move forward, turn left, etc)
based on command input on the cab's joystick and was equipped with a video
camera, the image of which was displayed on the cab's screen. The kicker wa=
s
in the "fire" button and the water-gun with which the helmet-wearer was to
be outfittted. This was supposed to investigate guilt and responcibility bu=
t
nobody seemed to feel especially guilty, probably due to the hot weather.

Anyway, it struck me that if you can do that you could also make the
commands be synthesised by a livecoding system instead of a joystick. Such =
a
system could get it's input from a set of sensors (pressure seems especiall=
y
interesting but it might also be cool to analyise sound and make people
dance to music they can't themselves hear). This would basically "open up" =
a
representation of the central nervous system.

Of course this would require a lot of turst on the part of the wearer of
such equipment but that might be solvable to some degree by recruiting
somebody with a masochist streak (I often get the impression that's quite
common amongst programmers...), trading places with the programmer for the
next performance and/or a padded overall.

Cheers,
Kas.

Actually, I've got a dancemat here myself. I'd definitely be up for some

Subject: Re: [livecode] livecoding at ICMC - update


Hello livecoders!

I have booked the venue for the livecoding night at ICMC. It will take
place on Monday 25th August in the evening, here:

http://www.blackboxbelfast.com/

(in the 100 capacity cafe area, not the main bit).

We'll be joining forces with Ajay Kapur who will be providing some live
Indian electronic music.=20

They have a projector and a screen, which is cool. They also have a PA,
but I am not sure about monitor speakers yet. (waiting for info there).

I have also enquired about the internet connection for those livecoders
in remote locations... I suspect we will at best be given access to a
typical NAT wifi set up (probably without admin access to the router),
which might make it difficult to forward OSC messages directly. So we
might have to do something clever like sending messages via an
intermediary web server which we poll from inside the wifi network.=20

Ajay thinks we should charge to get in. This seems reasonable so we can
cover the =C2=A3100 booking fee and sort out the artists with at least be=
er
money.=20

The list of performers is as follows (in no particular order!):

alex mclean
matthew yee-king
luc van weelden
fredrik remotely crashing //beginning of a haiku?
drb fairly possible
son of click
gmfc

plus Ajay's gang.=20

So - it's on!

best

Matthew

Dear Toplap folk,

This scholarship opportunity may be of interest to people on this list, and
I encourage further distribution to those you think may be interested.

Cheers,

PhD Scholarship in Adaptive Media

The Australasian CRC for Interaction Design (ACID) is offering a new
doctoral scholarship for a suitably qualified candidate to undertake
research into computational processes for generative music and graphics.
This scholarship is funded by ACID for a period of three years. The positio=
n
will be based in the Creative Industries Faculty at the Queensland
University of Technology (QUT) in Brisbane, Australia.

ACID is a leader in the research and design of innovative technologies and
digital media that support new forms of interaction and collaboration.

The successful applicant will work with a team of researchers working on
ACID's Adaptive Media project. This project investigates new methods for
providing computational support for creative activities through generative
algorithmic processes that extend or automate creation of digital media
content.

The successful applicant will suggest a doctoral study that strongly aligns
with this project and will work with Associate Professor Andrew Brown and
Research Fellow Andrew Sorensen. Applicants must also successfully apply fo=
r
admission to the doctoral project at QUT.

The doctoral scholarship is valued at $20K per annum (tax exempt) and may b=
e
renewed, subject to satisfactory progress.

Applications are invited from both Australian citizens and International
Students applying to study at QUT. Successful applicants are expected to
enrol in 2008.

Further information is available from Associate Professor Andrew Brown, PO
Box 2008, Kelvin Grove, Qld, 4059 (Phone: 07 3337 7821; Fax: 07 3337 7834;
Email: andrew@hidden Applications should be sent direct to Associate
Professor Andrew Brown and should include a curriculum vitae, a copy of an
academic transcript, and the names and contact details of at least two
referees.

Closing Date: Friday, 31 August 2008

After a summer break, instructionset is back:

[August 2008] Surprise

    According to the principle of least surprise, often cited in
    programming literature, software should be invisible. Write some
    software that only conforms to this principle for 10 seconds or so
    before astonishing the user in some manner. Code obfuscation is
    optional.

Subject: [livecode] make art festival



Hi,

I'm helping put together an evening of live coding in Poitiers, France
on Saturday 29th November as part of the fine Make Art festival
(http://makeart.goto10.org/).  If you're up for doing a
talk/performance/workshop then please let me know.  

The catch is that this is a festival for artists using/making free
software, and they're being strict about the operating systems this
year, so you're not allowed to use mac os/windows/other closed OS.  Also
I'm afraid they probably only have money to bring people from around
Europe.

This will be a nice event, please get in touch if you want to be

I do hope everyone attending make art will be using computers that they've 
built themselves from open source specifications, rather than relying on 
proprietary hardware.

couldn't you use OS X as long as you kept to the command line and avoided 
GUIs? Isn't Darwin itself open source, just not Aqua?

The restriction below has a dose of fun about it, don't get me wrong, but 
I'm not sure how much of a distraction such a prescription is from more 
interesting questions...

Subject: [livecode] CALL FOR SHORT STEREOPHONIC SOUNDSCAPE & HOERSPIEL WORKS


CALL FOR SHORT STEREOPHONIC SOUNDSCAPE & HOERSPIEL WORKS

 >A DIAMOND IN THE MUD<
A Miniature Audio Exhibition of Stereophonic Soundscape & H=F6rspiel =
Works

PROJECT CONCEPT:
It is an Asian concept rooted in Buddhism that self-cultivation can be =20=

developed at home as a householder and is not merely confined to a =20
temple or monastery. Buddhist believe that enlightened beings are =20
those who "grew" out of the "mud" of the material world. So, like the =20=

lotus flower, which penetrates through sullied mud and water, but =20
emerges unspoiled, enlightened beings are beautiful and pure even =20
though they grow up in the material world. The phrase "a diamond in =20
the mud" is an analogy for this and in keeping with it the Digital Art =20=

Weeks would like to issue this call to artists and to submit pre =20
recorded works (Soundscape, H=F6rspiel, Poetry) in regard to the =20
beautiful and the sullied. The works will be chosen on their ability =20
to transcend the listeners into a "moment of tranquilly" and out of =20
the confines of the everyday, or as expressed in the Diamond Sutra: =20
"Dwell upon nothing and produce the pure mind."

PLAYBACK SYSTEM:
Constructed as a dock for Apple's famed iPod, the iCarta stereophonic =20=

audio playback system will be used to play back all of the selected =20
works. The systems not only offers an interesting solution for public =20=

pod-casting, but it also acts uniquely as a bathroom dispenser for the =20=

indispensable: Le papier toilette.

- Art Clay, DAW, Artistic Director (c) 2008


DEADLINE: Moday, 15th September 2008. Notification of acceptance of =20
proposals will be sent out on or before Monday, 22nd September 2008.

APLLICATION FORM:
http://www.digitalartweeks.ethz.ch/web/DAWPlus/SoundScape08

For more information regarding the call please write directly to: =
arthurclay@hiddencom=20

*from wikipedia:

Coltan smuggling has also been implicated as a major source of income =20=

for the military occupation of Congo. An activist website, Toward =20
Freedom, states that the search for coltan has fueled a brutal =20
conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo; they state that demand =20
for coltan has caused Rwandan military groups and western mining =20
companies to seek hundreds of millions of dollars worth of the rare =20
metal, often by forcing prisoners-of-war and even children to work in =20=

the country's coltan mines. [9]
To many, this raises ethical questions akin to those of conflict =20
diamonds. Owing to the difficulty of distinguishing legitimate from =20
illegitimate mining operations, several electronicsmanufacturers have =20=

decided to forgo central African coltan altogether, relying on other =20
sources.[citation needed] The high-tech industry's demand for tantalum =20=

clearly has fueled an increase in coltan mining worldwide =96 including =20=

in the Congo region.
Toward Freedom states that the 2000 launch of the Sony PS2 required a =20=

large increase in production of electric capacitors, which are =20
primarily made with tantalum, which greatly increased the world price =20=

of the powder from $49/pound to a $275/pound, resulting in accelerated =20=

mining of the Congolese hills containing coltan. Sales in computers, =20
mobile phones, and DVD players spiked around this same time. Sony =20
claims it has discontinued its use of tantalum acquired from the =20
Congo, and sourced it from a variety of mines in several different =20
countries. Researcher David Barouski states =93The coltan ore trades =20
hands so many times from when it is mined to when SONY gets a =20
processed product, that a company often has no idea where the original =20=

coltan ore came from, and frankly don't care to know. But statistical =20=

analysis shows it to be nearly inconceivable that SONY made all its =20
PlayStations without using Congolese coltan." [9]
All three countries named by the United Nations as smugglers of coltan =20=

have denied being involved. Austrian journalist Klaus Werner has =20
documented links between multi-national companies like Bayer and the =20
illegal coltan traffic.[10] Likewise has Johann Hari written on the =20
connections between coltan resources and the genocide in Congo.[11]=20
[12] A United Nations committee investigating the plunder of gems and =20=

minerals in the Congo listed in its final report[7] approximately 125 =20=

companies and individuals involved in business activities breaching =20
international norms. Companies accused of irresponsible corporate =20
behavior are for example Cabot Corporation, Eagle Wings Resources =20
International,[13] George Forrest Group[14] and OM Group.[15]

I believe you can roll your own (literally this time) using oil and paper.

This *will* make the people doing maintenance after you curse you,
particularly if your work would end up in a museum and integrity of the work
as a whole is a issue (not making this up; this is a serious issue for
some). I'm not sure vegetable oil could be used for this, if not that would
raise more issues.

To me this festival seems to be about "independance" and indeed the question
is how far you feel you need to go before you are "free". While I agree that
any line drawn on that scale is drawn at a completely arbitary point I also
agree with where it's drawn here. Then again; challenges to such notions
seem quite healthy to me as well.

Yours,
Kas.

Way late reaction...
but we did experience this problem in the C-Base in Berlin during the LAC2007.
We didn't find a solution for it, other than playing one of the pieces from 
two computers with manual synching.
Frank Barknecht's performance suffered completely from this and we didn't 
project unfortunately... but you could look at his screen instead...

Maybe analog amplification is a solution... using a giant Fresnel lens to 
amplify your computer screen, or an external screen connected to your 
laptop... could be a nice alternative. Dangerous with outdoor performances 
though.

sincerely,
Marije

Yet later, I wonder now why I didn't reply before but it seems nobody so fa=

pointed out the option of lifting the laptop's adapter's ground This is -in
my experience with laptop performance- nearly always essential. The one
exception seems to be some soundcards that can be powered using their own
adapter but even then many situations benefit.

Wherever possible keep lighting and sound on separate electrical groups,
mainly because of light dimmers.  This is what all larger clubs do. Of
course for livecoding you may not typically end up in large professional
clubs but you can "fake" it in more improvised situations running a long
power-cable to the local kitchen. Kitchens (or bathrooms with a bath) tend
to be held to higher grounding standards by law, I had good experiences
doing that in some squats that didn't have a high electricity that was
"clean" enough to run the notoriously sensitive MMT8 off. Yes, that will
raise eyebrows, just do it, if at all possible find the socket meant for
laundry machines and roll off the whole cable if you intend to power a PA
off that.

Also; DI boxes. I sugest always using DI's wherever available with the
exception of the situation where your own mixer or soundcard can supply rea=
l
ballanced XLR/ or TRS jacks to the PA.

Some types of power plug can be inserted in two ways, even grounded ones
(this is typical in the EU with the notable exception of Belgium). If you
have hum it can help to take such plugs out, twisting them 180=B0 and
re-inserting which can bring different appliances in phase. Obviously there
is no need for that in situations where you can't do that (grounded US / UK
plugs).

If none of that helps you can start randomly switching ballanced and

Subject: [livecode] live-patching workshop ideas


Hey y'all

I'm looking for ideas for the live-patching workshop, to be given at  
dorkcamp (http://dorkbotlondon.org/camp08/) - example PD or Max  
patches, diagrams, ideas for musical (or non-musical?) instruments  
are all great!  The basic premise is - livecoding using humans and  
simple "actions" that they can perform.  Sort of like PD if everyone  
became objects and used real cords as patch cords.

See http://dorkbotlondon.org/wiki/index.php/ 
Human_Patching_Live_Coding for some details from before - we also did  
this at Openlab4 earlier this year.

Cheers

Hi Evan,

I think doing human-programming with patch environments is especially
interesting given that the patch environments are themselves
representations of physical objects - i.e. analog synthesizers with
patch cords. So it's physical world to virtual to physical again,
forming a chain of whisper-down-the-lane representations of
representations (or, fun with semiotics). Some top-of-the-head ideas
that might be difficult but fun:

a) mapping the original item at times, rather than the virtual - for
example, a person representing a metronome rather than a metro object
b) running a second parallel human patch where the humans represent
the way the original patch might be done with analog means (which
wouldn't necessarily entail the same objects as in the Max/PD-based
human patch)
c) adding another layer of representation somehow - for example,
building an abstraction that  represents a person imitating a metro,
rather using than the metro object itself.

etc...

Anyway, would be great to see video of the workshop afterwards!

Happy connecting,
-Amy

Well, I think the single most popular platform in computing ever, the
"IBM-compatible" (which now even includes Apple) got where it is by being
open. You can get hardware that conforms to that standard from any number o=
f
manufacturers without a need to depend on a  single one and because it's
standardised your choice of OS's is quite large on that platform as well.

Clearly it has to end somewhere or we would never get round to making music
but I think it ends in a acceptable way. I'm not independent in the sense
that I can make my own CPU in the kitchen but I am in the sense that if
Intel no longer pleases me I can go with AMD and basically get the exact
same thing.

I agree it's exclusive but I think there are interesting effects of that
beyond "compositional constraints" and "seeing whether Nick will boot Linux
from a CD" :=ACp. Constraints have a way of forcing you to consciously noti=
ce
things you may have taken as a given. These days the tools used for creativ=
e
expression are often made by large companies instead of by the artists
themselves or by local craftsmen. There are any number of people that can
make a brush but only a single company that makes Photoshop, yet Photoshop
has become all but synonymous with "working with images".

There are many political and economical implications to that but the angle
that attracts me is the exact "10 years to master a instrument" we talked
about before. Many electronic instruments and many programs don't last that
long. Many instruments are build cheaply and programs may no longer functio=
n
after a OS update or the company may change it's direction and you may not
like the program that much in the next version. This is strongly related to
progress but it also means you may lose your 10 years investment. Personall=
y
I'd like to be independent of that and I feel pointing out this phenomenon
in such a way is more interesting and more important then the actual
constraints on individual artists participating in this festival, as
interesting as those may be.

So am I, but I found that after I switched to a open instrument as my main
one this became much easier. I don't think this need be inherently the case
but with some exceptions I experience the open instruments at my disposal a=
s
being more open-ended then the closed commercial ones as well.

To me the stylistic influence of the instrument is a interesting and
important matter and I find it's cause for concern that many modern
instruments make strong assumptions about the musical styles they'll be use=
d
for, assumptions that seem to be based by companies on what's popular at th=
e
moment. I experience a link between the cheap build quality of a lot of
modern hardware and the short-livedness on fashionable styles and I wonder
what this will do to the long-term development of musicians using them.


> None of this is meant to be inflammatory, just expressing some concerns.

I'm not sure about Marije but I feel your concerns are entirely healthy and
to me it's clear that a debate like this is exactly what these constraints
were meant to encourage, probably in adition to showing the world what can
be acomplished with open/free tools, something I suspect many people aren't
as aware of as we here are.

Perhaps it would be nice to be inflamatory, there are important questions
here and it would be troublesome if people *didn't* have strong feelings
about their instruments but I suspct we already agree on most counts.

To get back to building your own hardware... when I grew up my dad was 
building his own UNIX machine from scratch and apparently the machine was in 
use for years after and more used by his colleagues at work than the newer 
commercial machines they had available. Probably the machine still works if 
we'd hook it up again...
Not sure how this is relevant, but it should make clear that you can build 
your own machine if you want.

I also think that open source is not synonimous to independent. In fact one 
could say that open source is more dependent than closed source, since for it 
all to work it depends heavily on a large community.

Well, I think it is less constraining than composition calls which call for 
compositions for a specific instrumental ensemble.

I think this last aspect is quite important. To raise public awareness that 
you can achieve a lot with open/free tools will encourage more people to even 
start making stuff, not being faced with huge investments which are beyond 
their reach. Festivals which put these open source tools in the spotlight 
will achieve such awareness. And let artists who use these tools run less 
often into reactions like: "is SuperCollider actually running on Linux?".

> Perhaps it would be nice to be inflamatory, there are important questions
> here and it would be troublesome if people *didn't* have strong feelings

Personally for me, with hardware and software being my main tools to make 
stuff, I do need these to be free, so that if I'd want, I can look into how 
it works to learn more about it.

To me, open source is quite similar to the ideal of a free science.

So it raises interesting challenges also in the area of safety...
With companies protecting their in house knowledge, engineers there are often 
faced with ethical concerns regarding the safety of the product they develop 
versus the pressure of boards of directors. In many cases they cannot be open 
about their results, and they have to decide whether to risk their job and 
talk to the press, or not.
For the general safety this is a dangerous thing, as in the end those who find 
their own personal job more important than the safety of the use of their 
product are the ones ending up in these jobs.

On the other hand I do understand that the European (and Western) culture 
comes from a long tradition of closedness of technological knowledge (compare 
the medieval guild structure for different crafts/trades), so it will not be 
easy to create a counterstream to this.

sincerely,
Marije

Well, no, not synonymous but communities can collapse like companies can go
bankrupt and when that happens you would at least have a fighting chance to
keep using your instrument if you have the source.

Companies will sometimes have a interest in making it *harder* to use a
instrument. I'm thinking for example of Clavia trying to take Nord Modulars
off the second hand market in order to sell more G2's or Apple buying Logic
and dropping Windows support in order to sell more Mac's. It was especially
Clavia that scared me there, after I realised what was going on I promptly
stopped buying hardware that doesn't adhere to standards.

While this doesn't equate to independance per-se in open source I don't feel
people are trying to make me more dependant on them either. I the end we
will always depend on some people and some things, that's perfectly natural
and normal but personally I recomend running when you notice people are
trying to make you more dependant on them.

This is just one factor where I think the type of software used can affect
the artistic process. Another that intests me is that I feel it's natural
for a artists to want to understand the material (s)he works with on order
to be able to exert more control. I find it reasuring that when I'm
uncertain about the exact functioning of some feature in ChucK I can look at
the source and at times that's turned out to be the most efficient way. When
I have similar questions about closed source instruments I have to hope I
will be able to determine such things through trial and error. This becomes
especially important to me in the case of bugs and with some companies that
try to actively supress bugs becoming public. Of course that affects
everybody but it strikes me as especially relevant in the artistic process
where control or even just the experience of control can be at least as
important as the final results.

When Nick says such questions aren't the most important ones then I might
agree but I do think factors like this can affect the type of expression he
is after and can both help and harm such processes.

Yours,
Kas.

Subject: [livecode] A night of live coding at 53 Rusden Street


We recently (Aug 12th) ran the first in a series of Backyard Soiree's  
held in Brisbane at 53 Rusden St.  Although these are not dedicated  
live coding nights it turned out that our inaugural event featured  
four solo live coding performances.  Callum Hedemann, Andrew Brown,  
Andrew Sorensen and Thorin Kerr each performed a 20 minute set.  We  
recorded all the performances including both screen casts and video  
for all except Thorins set (which is audio and video but was not  
screencast).  You can find full recordings and excerpts on the  
Impromptu gallery page.  The downloadable movies are the original  
screencasts with picture-in-picture using the hand-held video footage  
mixed in post-production.

http://impromptu.moso.com.au/gallery.html

For those that are interested, we captured the screencasts using a  
commodity home theatre dvd/hdd recorder.  We sent composite from the  
laptops to the recorder and then sent composite out of the recorder  
and onto the projector.  Audio came from the same headphone  
distribution box that the audience used (backyard soiree's are  
headphone gigs).  Amazingly it all worked remarkably well and I can  
recommend this as a cheap approach for others wanting to record  
performances without extra processing load on the laptop.  Composite  
obviously doesn't give a great picture but given the ease and price of  
this setup it's an option worth considering.  The only slight problem  
was syncing the hand-held video footage to the screencasts in "post- 
production".  I wanted to do a picture-in-picture style thing with  
bit's of hand-held camera footage mixed onto the screencast.  In the  
end I decided not to worry to much about the hand-held video sync,  
primarily because I'm lazy, but also because it is really only there  
to provide some context for the screencast.

Cheers,
Andrew.S

p.s. Us Aussie's would love it if someone could record the Belfast  
live coding night and post it online somewhere.  Good luck to all  
those performing!!!

I share your distaste for "power mongers" but humble acknowledge that people
like me need some "business guys" or there won't be any records or parties
of larger sizes... but this? Personally I like "Idea men" ( m / f ! ); I
like reading their books, I like debating them deep into the night, I like
running their programs and enjoying their music, text, code and/ or visuals.
On occasion a I get to  feel flattered to be called one.

I respect what you seem to want to accomplish but I'd scrap that bit.

Lovely! I'd be delighted with some stickers; with one on my laptop people
will know there are others that are at least as crazy as I am and hopefully
they'll be less worried. :=AC)

However; Thanks to Nick's generosity I already have the toplap_cd1 (unless
my suggestion for Fibonacci-style numbering was taken and there are two CD'=
s
numbered "1" now). Rather then have double copies I'd rather see one go to
somebody who needs it more then I do. If you have trouble finding such a
person I'd be happy to.

Cheers,
Kas.

PS, Luc, Finish ChucKist Frostburn found me a amazing solution for that

Dear list,

I'm having a small issue with projecting, or rather others are having a
issue with it and I'm having a hard time understanding.

You see, I was asked for a tech-rider for this Today's Art festival in The
Hague gig. I listed a small table, a chair, a projector... and the poor
organiser seemed to nearly faint. A projector was out of the question so I
offered to arrange one myself.. but according to her any projection at all
is out of the question.

Now I can't see how you can have a space that can fit a few dozen people and
not be able to project a screen. Ok, I could imagine such a space but I
wouldn't organise a party in it.

I've been thinking about a few options like borrowing one of those huge
flatscreen TV's that have monitor inputs or being stubborn and bringing a
projector with a screen anyway and seeing how far I can get on my own,
perhaps projecting on the ceiling and seeing who will lie down or something.

Does anybody have any experience with techniques to sort this sort of thing
out? Is there some sort of sure-fire solution or would I need to take a look
at this magical space that won't allow for projection at all myself ahead of
time? Any factors that need special attention?

Any hints, tips and experiences would be very welcome.

Yours,
Kas.

Just go for it... projection should be easy- and will work on almost any
surface as long as you aren't bothered about the quality of the image being
perfect. The only constraints I can see that would make them worry are:
1. room being really tiny (unlikely)
2. the room being too light (possible but you can work round this)
3. Not being able to get power there (possible)
4. the old chestnut- Health and safety- (likely)
5. They have curated you into a slot / space and are being inflexible
(likely)

My figuring is that they don't want to run wires to the middle of a room or
adjust the set up. I would just take one and tell them it is needed for the
piece and that you have to have one so are bringing it yourself.

hope that helps
Jim

Hey Kas, what if they've planned some kind of lighting effect themselves?
Then a projector might be a really bad idea, especially if that's your
only option.

This is roughly what I figured  I was for a moment concerned about how to
put the projector up on a high location but figured tables and chairs are
available everywhere and of course there is tape. That should work. Perhaps
I can steal, borrow or press-gang a screen as well.

the label I'm on and I'd be really surprised if anybody gave lighting much

I'm in a bit of a weird spot here because this festival is supposed to be
about -well- "Today's Art" and some of it is (installations, experimental
performances, etc) but a lot of it is also simply modern dance music, if
edging towards the less mainstream. Of course live electronic dance music i=

No problem at all! I'd do it again too! Here's an mp3... its recorded on
a zoom h4 using the built in mics so it is a bit rough but you do get
the vibe of the event:

There was a nice chap there who has some video of the event. He said
he'd put it on yootuba so keep an eye out for that.

hopefully nothing incriminating!

it was a really great evening, thanks Matthew + Ajay.

there was a lot of interest around live coding at ICMC, and a lot of
other festivals including live coding events...  maybe we should plan
another live coding festival next summer?  i could look into applying
for funding to host one in the south east of england, unless anyone else
fancies taking it on?

Hey,
just a quick question- does anybody / is anybody particularly proficient
with electronics? I work at SPACE in Hackney now and we are always looking
for people that can do little bits of electronics work...

for example- we have 2 video decks where the ports have come loose. We think
it is just a case of exchanging the firewire ports and soldering etc. The
warantee has expired and  It would cost us a fortune to send these things
away and we would rather give some cash to artists / people that can do this

Get in touch if you have the power!

Since on a celular automata you depend on the state of the cells of
the past cycle you could easily parallelize the process.
Dividing the space in n parts and run a process or thread on each of
these parts.
Watch out for the borders.

So I now have N-processes or threads. They have to be initialized or ordered
in a certain way. The "parallel" then becomes a satisfactory illusion, but
does it solve
the problem of "true simultaneity"? No.

Even pipelining inside processors can be seen as some sort of parallelization.
If you have a multi core processor or multiple processors you can get
some parallelization.
What about clustering?


One of my college teachers used to say that my couldn't be sure if we
were living in a parallelized universe or on a singled threaded :-)
Neither we could know if we are on a time-split system (we can get
frozen any moment!)

Nah, for the kind of thing I'm talking about I need a whole SETI@hidden
Apparently, CAM-8 was the last attempt to create a computers with many

Frankly, yes. If I tell you the whole plan, there is no doubt you'll think
I'm off
my chuddies, thats why I can only say at this point that "collaborative

I'd take a somewhat simpler approach then Marcel (who's take I can't quite
comment on since I don't completely understand it).

I'd make a array of "cell" objects that hold both their state (say as a
integer) and a variable containing their next state where it has been
computed.

I'd loop over the array, for each cell  calculating the "next state" based
on it's neighbour's "state". Then I'd loop over it again and copy all "next
state's" to the "states" and out comes a updated cellular automaton.

If you'd like to get clever you could call the two variables "state A" and
"state B" and instead of the second loop simply swap which one of the two
refers to the current state and which one is the temporary holder for
already calculated results, that would save some CPU.

There may be better methods but at least this will work; if you do run into
issues you could always go peek into the source of open implementations
later.

Yours,
Kas.

The trouble is the "looping over the array", and especially on which cell
should it start. To add to the confusion, it's a ringed array. In my vision
of things, all cells start simultaneously. There are no loops except within
the cells own structure.

That's not the issue actually. I've already done much of the homework.
Google for a paper called "computational monadology". It's Leibniz's
Monadologie re-written as cellular automata theory. I may have mailed you

It's a higher-level language for MapReduce operations.

Which means it's a way of processing data across a network of
computers. So you can pass each cell out to a single computer and it
will process it (more realistically every 3 cells for a CA or every 9
cells for Life). This would allow you to process amazingly large CAs
very quickly.

Actually, with the method I suggested it does *not* matter where you start.
Every time you want your CA to update you'll need to calculate a new value
for every cell and after all new values have been calculated you update the=
m
to expressing this new state in one swoop. You could do this in any order
you please.

I hope so :=AC)

If I understand the original question correctly your problem is that you
don't want the order in which you calculate your new values to matter; you
fear that you'll start at cell1, that it will change from white to black an=
d
that this will affect cell2 when you calculate the new value for cell2,
right?

My first suggestion was to make every cell hold two values. First of all it
clearly needs to hold a value for the state it's in now, say a 1 or a 0 to
indicate white or black. I'm suggesting you also make it hold a *second*
value (also a 1 or 0)  that indicates the state it's going to have in the
next generation once we finish calculating that generation (so once we have
gone over all the cells).

So; we'd start at cell1, which is -say- white right now. We calculate that
it will be black in the next round so we store that in the second value,
leaving it's current state be for now. We then move on to cell2 and base th=
e
calculations for cell2 on cell1 still being white as that's what it's state
still says right now; never touched that so far. We store the outcome of
this in cell2's second value, leaving cell2's current state intact as well.

Once we have done this for all cells we have a series of cells that still
holds the same state it had when we started but every cell now also holds
-in it's second value- the state it should have in the new generation. At
this point we can swap the meaning of the two values. We simply define that
now the "second value" defines their "state" and at that moment we instantl=
y
have a updated CA that correctly holds it's new pattern without calculation
order having mattered.

I hope it's more clear now?

I meant to look for a efficient way of updating all cells. I think mine is
quite decent but perhaps somebody more clever came up with a optimisation.

No matter how many state variables you conjure up, you're going to have to
look up the nearest neighbour's state variable to calculate the next value.
In your system, I'm not sure if they are automatons at all. The cells seem
to behave completely independent of their environment, almost autonomously.
Comprenez?

subject of cells looking at their neighbours.

I wrote it with Wolfram's 1d 2state version in mind but it should work for
Conway's life or anything along those lines as well.

I was assuming all cells are governed by the same rule or set of rules and
so suggesting making those rules a part of the system of updating and not of
a member function of the cells itself. If it's all the same anyway there is
no need to create large and complicated objects taking up memory and
generally complicating matters. That's just a question of the architecture
of the program though, that need not affect how the end result behaves.

Perhaps I was misunderstanding the whole question?

I'm afraid so, Kas.  In my schema all cells starts looking at each other at
the same moment in "time". If you re-read the original question I clearly
posit the problem of "true simultaneity". In your schema you always only
start at some arbitrary but lone cell.

And where you start matters to me a lot - everywhere.

Well, in your original question you ask "The question is this: You can't
possibly update all the cells
simultaneously can you?" and that is exactly what my method will do. It
won't *calculate* all cells at the same time since a cpu will only do one
thing at the same time but they will *update* at the same moment which is
very different and where you start calculating won't matter; it won't affect
a thing, you could do it forwards, backwards or at random and the result
will be the same which is exactly what you need here.

If for some conceptual reason you need to *calculate* them all at the same
time then it's probably time to rent time in some super-computer meant for
weather simulations. Really, read my explanations back.

Yours,
Kas.

You said it Kas, "a cpu will only do one thing at the same time". So I've
already assumed that I need a million cpu's. How I'm going to get them is my
problem.

Yes, I noticed, but this assumption is incorrect, in fact this kind of thing
is easier on a single CPU as there is less need to sync stuff.

I'm not going to argue this any further as I could probably just have
written the whole thing in the time that was now spend on this.

No offence; you can try my method or you could send me a outline of what you
need exactly (it sounds like Wolfram's CA's on a circular line?) and I'll
see when I get round to writing it (probably tomorrow or so) but I'm not
going to play "is / isn't" over this. I mean that in the most friendly
possible way.

So do I, my friend, but now I think you're so far off the issue that we
should just close this discussion. I already have the answer I needed, so
lets just leave it here. There is no point arguing more.

Subject: [livecode] fluxus 0.15


A new fluxus!

http://www.pawfal.org/fluxus
http://www.pawfal.org/fluxus/files/fluxus-0.15rc3.tar.gz

This release introduces some big new components, and the usual load of
fixes, features and improvements.

* Fluxa - audio synthesis designed for functional programming and livecod=
ing
* Frisbee - an experimental game engine based on PLT's FrTime language
* Midi support
* Support for PLT 4.x
* Multiple camera/view rendering
* Raytracing for collision detection and polygon sampling
* Improved procedural texture operations
* More methods for polygon evaluation
* Lots of optimisations, fixes and other additions
* New examples and documentation

This build will also be availible on the upcoming release of pure:dyne, a
live disk linux distribution of free audio/visual software:
http://code.goto10.org/projects/puredyne/

Happy livecoding...

Um, has anybody toyed with the idea of building an IRC bot that
converts the chat commands into locally executed audio synthesis
commands? This is all hypothetical, of course.

You log in, you type commands as if you're chatting, and users perceive
the change together because they can hear it. The bot is using the chat
commands to drive audio synthesis locally on the client.

Everybody hears the same sound over the group of users and lurkers.
It's a bit like editing the Wikipedia, except you're composing music.

there are two students from the utrecht school of arts who did something
with this.
i'll bet that laurens van der wee can tell some more about this as he is in
the same class as those guys.

Subject: Re: [livecode] fluxus 0.15


Hi Dave,

Looks great, I just compiled it on OS X (10.4.11) from svn source but  
there are a few issues (in no particular order):

1. running self-test on the examples directory, the wire.scm example  
(and a few others) has some errors (due to osc?) and doesn't display  
anything:

output:

, given: {23 40.3 "fluxus"}; other arguments were: "/hello?" "ifs"

  === context ===
/Users/evan/cvs/fluxus/examples/osc-test.scm:4:0: osctest
/Applications/PLT Scheme v3.99.0.25/collects/fluxus-015/scratchpad.ss: 
377:0: default-fluxus-frame-callback

osc-spdata-get called without an objected being grabbed
pdata-get called without an objected being grabbed
pdata-get called without an objected being grabbed
pdata-get called without an objected being grabbed
pdata-get called without an objected being grabbed
...


2. it would be nice if, for the self-test, you could just pass  
"examples" as the directory instead of "examples/"

3. when compiling (in the first few lines of output), it shows an  
error about ld not finding libfluxus - it looks like it is looking  
for it in the parent folder of the fluxus distro, and not the fluxus  
distro itself.


I'd really like to use Fluxus for a class I'm teaching on programming  
& interactive art at UCreative starting in 2 weeks, and I'll try and  
make a self-contained Mac app of it for that purpose (although I am  
not a very skillful mac app packager).

Cheers
Evan





Cheers
Evan

Than did it, yes. But he used a speech library rather than a  
synthesis algorithm. It was actually on the ICMC this year: a certain  
number of clients, able of typing in text which was then send to an  
engine, local on every machine, automatically downloaded by the  
software, which did the speech.
I did not do this myself, so I might be wrong on some points here.
All patched together in Max/MSP, by the way, using a Java-based  
network thingie.

I'll forward this mail to the man himself.

This was using IRC a/o Fall 2006 when I was playing around with it:

AdC and Rohrhuber are doing things like this with SuperCollider...

Sorry to jump into this discussion, after you have given it up...

But how realtime do you need this to be? Do you really need your answers in 
one or two instruction cycles of a bunch of CPU's running at their full 
speed?
I cannot really believe that (assuming you want the output to be audible or 
visible). And if you don't, you can easily slice up time in larger chunks and 
do calculations for more cells at a time, based on the algorithm Kassen 
proposes.

I think you have to separate between the concept of the algorithm and the 
actual implementation on real hardware of it. There is usually a pretty big 
gap between that, because of how CPU's and the hardware around it is built. 
You can write beautifully simple high level code, but at the nitty gritty 
hardware level, it is just passing through voltage levels through some chips, 
and interpreting the results of that... even in your multi-milliion cpu 
scheme, things would not be completely simultaneous...

Synching that many cpu's adds a lot of extra delay, especially since in the 
algorithm data is dependant on neighbouring data. If you delve into parallel 
computing and architecture of such systems a little, you would see that 
communication between the cpu's is actually quite costly.


So, to get around all these issues, I suggest you just write your algorithm in 
conceptual code and publish that. Conceptual art does not suffer from 
implementation issues. That is, as long as you keep it conceptual.


sincerely,
Marije

Hi,

(Mac only:)
You might want to know this object:
http://www.iamas.ac.jp/~aka/max/#aka_speech
'Speakable items' is probably applescriptable, so you can make you  
own commands, or apps, like, say:
http://nsgn.net/software/say/

Applescript indeed!
-> Terminal enter:
osascript -e 'say "hi there"'
and there you go...

If you'd want to build your own Speech Synthesis for Mac, first read:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlainTalk and learn about diphones...

And also check out:
http://www.acapela-group.com/text-to-speech-interactive-demo.html
Hope this was a bit of help?

grz,
Than

Isn't this more or less how Powerbooks uplugged are performing? Admittedly
no IRC is involved but if you can send your chat over OSC it may not be
needed?

Seems a bit like the "speechless" project I did -- a multi-user web
page, people type in text which gets synthesised (TTS), filtered and
looped.  Rendering happens on the server and gets streamed to everyone.

Dear all,

I include below a link to a short work by Click that might amuse some of 
you. It's intended for headphone listening only, and you might find it most 
effective if you listen whilst there are other people around; perhaps in an 
office? There are possibly tenuous links to live coding; well, at the very 
least, there are some instructions.

best,
Nick

Autechre released a MD that was meant for random play or programming the
order of the songs. This was a nice use of the medium because MD players
have enough memory to pick a new random songs while the last is still
playing, then skip to it without interruption, unlike CD players at the
time. On the downside; the MD format only supports 99 tracks per disc.

When I downloaded this Mp3 I was half expecting it to work like one of those
"adventure" books you used to have in the 80's where at the bottom of the
page there would be instructions to "go to page 88 if you want to go into
the hallway, go to page 20 if you want to stay here".

Now, portable MP3 players are quite popular and have lots of memory and no
such silly limit on tracks beyond memory space. We could compile (pun very
much intended) a collection of short spoken pieces with instructions to
manipulate the outside world and/ or skip forward/randomise/repeat tracks.
I'm not sure whether there are portable MP3 players that can also record to
specific tracks, overdubbing them, but if there are then such a compilation
would actually be Turing-complete...

A "compilation of instructions" is quite funny to me as a theme.

Yours,
Kas.

Dear list,

The situation went from "you can't project there" to "you can but we're not
paying for it" to me stopping by the place and discovering a nice projector
mounted on the ceiling with matching screen above the stage. I later
gathered the organisation had taken to saying "no" to everything they
thought they could say "no" to as they were understaffed and over-stressed.
Understandable but in this case a single phone call could've saved trouble.
Oh, well, it turned out the projector was linked to a large TV by the
entrance which felt quite luxurious so I was happy.

I started out calmly while people walked in with sonifying my keyboard
presses which I thought would place more emphasis on the text being the
interface to the sound for random passers by. To cover up for silences while
thinking or debugging I sampled that output and made it play back in a
looped way at a randomised rate.

While my keyboard was merrily clicking and clanging along I set up some
infrastructure for sequencing and proceeded to generate some rhythms based
modulo functions on the sequencer's step number and melodies based around a
scale of integer multiples of 200Hz (I've been liking that lately). Despite
some initial bugs this went quite well once it got going. I later quantised
the re-sampling to the beat so it was less distracting yet still gave
variations and then developed some progressions and variations on this whole
structure.

I thought it was quite well received considering that few people there had
any idea about this way of performing (sadly Luc couldn't make it). Quite a
few people picked up on the idea. It's become clear to me that I need to
practice transitions, progressions and endings more; building up a piece
went much more smoothly then I had anticipated but once it was there I had
little idea of how to take it further and at times got lost in the amount of
open editing buffers. This is probably a result of my practice sessions
which have typically been build-ups followed by me listening to the
behaviour of the result for a while, then quitting. Looking back that's a
bit obvious but I suppose it took a 1 hour set for a live audience to
realise this. A hour is quite long and does demand a bit more planning ahead
or larger repertoire of manipulations on existing code, I suppose. I may
have been too reluctant to re-start with a completely fresh structure
halfway through as well. More practice is needed, particularly more
structure in practicing.

Still; not bad at all as a next step for me and I hope people who've taken
to (more or less) regular practice will be able to learn from my lesson
here.

Yours,
Kas.

I saw this in a movie called Avalon by Mamoru Oshii. The fictional computer
they show in it has all the keypresses sonified. It's like the keyboard
becomes a sort of tabla.

I've got that movie on DVD, most of the sound is very good there, IMHO.

It seems a popular device to have text appear  with a sound, especially the
ever popular green glowing terminal that sounds like a old-fashioned printer
while text comes in. More could be done with this, like extra emphasis on
closing statements with a ";" or different sounds for different groups of
characters.

It's a nice technique.

Yours,
Kas.

Apologies for being slow on the uptake, but this is really rather

In the meantime, does anyone know of any other similar works by Click?

Hi all,

I've set up an installation version of Al Jazari in the AlHambra, Granada=
,
Spain. It's part of "Youniverse" which is this year's Seville Biennale,
and runs till January 11th.

It's in the Palace of Charles V, so it finally really is livecoding for
royal drinking parties!

"The properties describing the sound objects make can be extracted from real

analyze a recording of an oil drum being hit, then use it in a game where an

same sample again and again, we hear all the variation and detail that
occurs when a real drum collides with different objects. Another advantage,
is that the memory footprint for the physical sample, which can generate so
much varied audio, is a small fraction of even one short audio sample.
Physical samples are also very flexible, and can be edited creatively for a
variety of effects."

Interesting, except that it compiles for Windows only, so far.

It was just a throw-away comment.

I got a bit excited thinking how you could make music with it, then  
watched the demo videos and found it mostly makes metallic clanging  
noises, and then industrial/musique concrete popped into my mind, and  
then Andrew McKenzie, and then I figured he could just plug this  
application into a sound system and he'd be sorted, then I closed my  
browser window and got on with my work.

Sorry.

Hi all,

Long long before Mac vs PC, the original flamewar was all about Spectrum
